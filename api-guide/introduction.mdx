## How to get your API key

An **API Key** is a unique identifier that allows you to authenticate and securely connect your applications with Fermion's APIs. It ensures that only authorized users or systems can access your platform’s data and perform actions such as managing [courses](/setting-up-course/prerequisites), [live classes](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes), [coding labs](/creating-coding-labs/what-are-coding-labs) or retrieving user information. By using an API key, you can safely integrate Fermion’s backend functionality into your own systems and automate tasks without exposing your account credentials.

You can get your Fermion API key with the following steps: 
<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API access">
