Fermion provides a comprehensive API for implementing affiliate marketing programs programmatically. This guide walks you through the complete process of setting up and managing affiliate marketing through our APIs.

## Overview

Affiliate marketing over API allows you to:

-   Create affiliate users programmatically
-   Generate custom affiliate links automatically
-   Track affiliate performance and conversions
-   Manage affiliate commissions and payouts
-   Integrate affiliate marketing into your existing systems

## Prerequisites

Before implementing affiliate marketing over API, ensure you have valid API key.

## Step 1: Create a New Affiliate User

First, create a new user account for your affiliate using the user creation API. Use this API endpoint: https://docs.fermion.app/api-reference/user/create-new-user

## Step 2: Generate Affiliate Custom Link

Now you can create custom affiliate link: https://docs.fermion.app/api-reference/affiliate-marketing/create-custom-affiliate-link

-   Once the affiliate user is created, generate a custom affiliate link for them.
-   Affiliate commission can be defined on a link basis.

## Step 3: Construct the Full Affiliate URL

Use the returned `affiliateLinkSlug` to construct the complete affiliate URL:

```
https://your-lms.com/a/:affiliateLinkSlug
```

## Real-time Conversion Tracking

You can set up webhooks to receive real-time conversion notifications. Go to Webhooks in your dashboard, and enable "Product purchase" webhook event.

<Info>
	If you do not see "Webhooks" in your admin dashboard, go to "Manage
	Features" > "Webhooks" and enable it.

## Track affiliate link data

You can also call `get-affiliate-link-stats` with the `affiliateLinkSlug` you got from step 1 to get stats like sale count, clicks and amount: https://docs.fermion.app/api-reference/affiliate-marketing/get-affiliate-link-stats
