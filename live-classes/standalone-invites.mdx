## Overview

Stand-alone invites allow you to share access to your **public [Live Events](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes)** without requiring students to register for a full course or cohort. They are ideal for special webinars, bootcamps, workshops, guest sessions, or promotional live events.  

With stand-alone invites, you can **control access**, **track participation**, and easily **revoke or reactivate** invites as needed. This provides flexibility for both organizers and attendees while keeping your events secure and manageable.
