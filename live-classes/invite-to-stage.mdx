Fermion's **Stage** feature is designed to make live sessions more interactive and engaging. It allows instructors to bring selected participants to the forefront, enabling them to share their screens, turn on their microphones and cameras, and actively participate in discussions. 
 
### Managing Participants on Stage

Livestreaming on Fermion allows you to invite multiple students and instructors to the call. Currently, you can have up to 50 participants on 'Stage', allowing them to screenshare, turn on their microphone and camera to interact with the participants.

For smaller sessions, instructors can also automatically add everyone to the stage  
for better communication between a small group of people.

On the right pane, you can see a list of participants who are present in your livestream. Enable **Automatically add everyone on stage?** checkbox to ensure all participants are on the stage and can interact with others.

Additionally, this option can be globally toggled from: **Settings** → **School Settings** → **Livestreaming settings**.

### Sharing System Audio
Live sessions often go beyond just visuals - you might want to play a tutorial video or share a demo 
with your live class. Fermion now allows instructors to **share system audio** while 
presenting on Stage, ensuring that any sound played from your device is 
heard clearly by all participants in real time.

Here is how you can share system audio:

1. Join the **Stage** during a live session.  

2. Click on **Share Screen**.  

3. In the sharing dialog, enable the **“Also share tab audio”** option.

4. Select the tab you want to share and confirm your selection by clicking **Share**.  

5. Begin your livestream. Participants will now hear both your system audio and your voice in real time.
