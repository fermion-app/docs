Fermion's **Stage** feature is designed to make live sessions more interactive and engaging. It allows instructors to bring selected participants to the forefront, enabling them to share their screens, turn on their microphones and cameras, and actively participate in discussions.

### Managing Participants on Stage

Livestreaming on Fermion allows you to invite multiple students and instructors to the call. Currently, you can have up to 50 participants on 'Stage', allowing them to screenshare, turn on their microphone and camera to interact with the participants.

For smaller sessions, instructors can also automatically add everyone to the stage
for better communication between a small group of people.

On the right pane, you can see a list of participants who are present in your livestream. Enable **Automatically add everyone on stage?** checkbox to ensure all participants are on the stage and can interact with others.

Additionally, this option can be globally toggled from: **Settings** → **School Settings** → **Livestreaming settings**.

You can also manually pick and choose which users are to be added onto the stage.

To do this, open the **Participants** or **Audience** panel on the right side. Users who are not currently on stage will be listed under "audience". Simply click the **Add on stage** button next to the user's name to invite them to the stage.

You may select individual users or use the **Select all** checkbox to bring multiple users to the stage at once. When added, they will be able to turn on their microphone, camera, and screen share to interact with the class.


### Managing permissions on stage

When users are brought on **stage** during a live session, instructors and hosts can **manage user permissions** directly from the participant list. The following controls are available for each user, as visible in the stage participant panel:

From left to right, you can:

- **Disable camera** for a user: Click the camera icon to turn off the user's camera (they will no longer be visible until they turn it back on).
- **Mute microphone** for a user: Click the mic icon to mute their audio in the session.
- **Promote to host**: Click the green shield icon to give a user host privileges. Hosts can manage users on stage, access the [whiteboard](/live-classes/whiteboard), screenshare, and control audio/video for others. Hosts can also end the session for everyone
- **Remove from hosts**: Click the yellow shield icon next to a host's name to revoke their host privileges. This will revert them to regular participant status, and they will lose the ability to manage other users or session controls.

- **Remove from stage**: Click the last icon (person with minus) to remove the user from the stage. The user returns to the audience and can no longer interact via mic or camera until re-invited.

> **Tip:** You can assign multiple hosts in a session. This is helpful for co-instructors, teaching assistants, or guest speakers who need full session control.

Managing these permissions allows you to maintain a smooth and secure class environment, keeping discussions focused and giving you control over who can present or participate at any time.

### Sharing System Audio

Live sessions often go beyond just visuals - you might want to play a tutorial video or share a demo
with your live class. Fermion now allows instructors to **share system audio** while
presenting on Stage, ensuring that any sound played from your device is
heard clearly by all participants in real time.

Here is how you can share system audio:

1. Join the **Stage** during a live session.

2. Click on **Share Screen**.

3. In the sharing dialog, enable the **“Also share tab audio”** option.

    ![Share System Audio](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/05-10-2025/Share%20system%20audio.arnfvv.png)

4. Select the tab you want to share and confirm your selection by clicking **Share**.

5. Begin your livestream. Participants will now hear both your system audio and your voice in real time.
