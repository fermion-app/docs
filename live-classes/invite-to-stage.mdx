Livestreaming on fermion allows you to invite multiple students/teachers on the call. Currently, you can have upto 50 participants on 'Stage', allowing them to screenshare , turn on their microphone and camera to interact and communicate with the participants.

Instructors can also automatically add everyone to the stage(Ideal for smaller live sessions with less than 50 participants) , which will allow seamless communication between a small group of people.
