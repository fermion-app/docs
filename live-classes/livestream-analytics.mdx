[Live classes](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes) on Fermion let you host interactive sessions with your learners in real time directly inside your [cohort based courses](/setting-up-course/prerequisites#what-is-a-cohort-based-course%3F). They’re a powerful way to connect, teach, and engage your audience.

After every session, Fermion automatically tracks detailed analytics so you can understand how your livestream performed. Various recorded statistics include attendance, engagement, and viewer behavior. These insights help you improve future sessions and better understand your learners’ interaction patterns.
