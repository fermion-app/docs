## Some pre-requisites

Before getting started, make sure of the following things:

1. Have a good internet connection before you stream so that the stream doesn't buffer or lag, these issues are usually caused by poor network connections.

2. Make sure that your browser and graphic drivers are up-to date, to avoid any issues that arise with outdated versions.

3. Keep a good webcam and a good microphone to ensure that you're able to stream smoothly to your learners.
