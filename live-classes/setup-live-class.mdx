Hosting a live class on Fermion lets you deliver lessons in real time, 
interact directly with your learners, and create an engaging, collaborative experience inside your course. 
Setting up a live session involves configuring essential details like your session title, description and timing of the session. You’ll also learn how to customize session behavior, enable reminders, add additional hosts, and configure recording or transcript options so your learners get the best possible experience.

Once your setup is complete, you’ll be ready to go live and manage your class using Fermion’s built-in tools for screen sharing, [whiteboarding](/live-classes/whiteboard), and [stage management](/live-classes/invite-to-stage).

## Some pre-requisites

Before getting started, make sure of the following things:

1. Have a good internet connection before you stream so that the stream doesn't buffer or lag, these issues are usually caused by poor network connections.

2. Make sure that your browser and graphic drivers are up-to date, to avoid any issues that arise with outdated versions.

3. Keep a good webcam and a good microphone to ensure that you're able to stream smoothly to your learners.

<Tip>
There’s no fixed upper limit on how many live sessions you can host at the same time. Accounts come with a **soft limit** that can be increased at any time by reaching out to us at support@codedamn.com.

## How to create a live class?

You can schedule live classes in [cohort based courses](/setting-up-course/prerequisites#what-is-a-cohort-based-course%3F) and go live with the help of the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Expand course items">
    Inside your syallbus section itself, click on `+ Add in this section` button to expand to all course items.

    ![+](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/22-09-2025/seelen-ui_4ek95Hm43J.drrsix.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a live class">
    Click on `Live class` from the available course items to add a live session.

    ![live class](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/22-09-2025/seelen-ui_nIvOSpjUY0.qmjnod.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit the live class">
    Click on the three dots next to the newly created live session and select `Edit`.

    ![edit](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/22-09-2025/seelen-ui_VTYjcY3SPW.nchnvx.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the live session">
    This will take you to a **Live Session Manager** page where you can configure a lot of the options related to this upcoming live session.

    #### Title & description
    ![title&desc](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/22-09-2025/seelen-ui_H2bBnKyKmV.eybmzt.png)

    #### Session configuration
    From here, you can set the time, duration of the stream. Click on **View stats** button to access the live stream's [analytics](/live-classes/livestream-analytics)
    
    Additionally, you can also add external hosts via email address. When a user joins the live class with the added email address, they will have host priviledges inside the livestream, that is they'll be able to access the [whiteboard](/live-classes/whiteboard), [screenshare](/live-classes/invite-to-stage), mute participants and end the session for everyone. 

    ![session config](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/01-10-2025/Arc_BKFqgRcDjs.igwafx.png)

    #### Additional settings
    You can configure the following:
    - [Recorded Playback](/live-classes/recording-and-captions): allows users to have access to the live session as a recorded video, that they can watch from their course page later.  
    - **Enable Reminders**: By default, reminder emails are sent to students 24 hours, 6 hours and 30 minutes before a live session starts.  
    - **Post-stream feedback collection**: Shows user a screen where they can submit feedback and star rating for the live session. These ratings can be accessed later at [livestream analytics](/live-classes/livestream-analytics).  
    - **Allow MP4 downloads**: You can make the session recording available to students as a downloadable video for offline access . 
    - [DRM playback](/live-classes/drm-and-watermarking): Turning this on will prevent users from screen recording and screenshotting your content.  
    - [Enable AI transcripts](/live-classes/recording-and-captions): You can opt-in to have transcripts generated for your live session, which will be directly available during playback of your recording as closed captions.  

    ![additional settings](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/01-10-2025/Arc_5mFRvv4ZJE.oymvek.png)

  </Step>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Go live">
    Once you proceed, you will see such a screen.

    ![](https://codedamn-website-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/04-01-2025/screenshot-000661%402x.xtzpea.png)

    Press on the button **Begin stream** when you want to start streaming.  
    Your users on the other side (inside the course item page) will be able to watch the stream normally.
  </Step>

  <Step title="End the session">
    Once your class concludes, click on **End Session** within the live call interface to properly end the live session. This ensures your recording is processed correctly and analytics are finalized.  
    <Check>
    Only **meeting hosts** can end the live class for everyone.
    </Check>

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Closing your browser tab or window does **not** automatically end the live session on Fermion’s side.  
A session only ends when you manually end it within the call or by invoking the **[End API](/api-reference/live/end-live-event-streaming)**.  
If the live call remains completely empty (no participants) for **1 hour**, the system will automatically end the session for you.
</Note>

## Scheduling live classes

You can schedule your live classes in two ways: **singularly** or in **bulk** using our Event Calendar.  

- **Live class Scheduling:** If you want to schedule a one-off session, you can set the date and time directly in the Event Calendar to create your live class. Learn more about this feature in [Schedule a live class in Event Calendar](/live-classes/event-calendar#how-to-schedule-a-live-session-directly-in-event-calendar)  
- **Bulk scheduling:** For multiple sessions at once, you can use the Event Calendar to plan your entire course's live sessions ahead of time. This is especially helpful if you want to maintain a consistent weekly or monthly schedule. Learn more about [Bulk Schedule live classes via CSV](/live-classes/event-calendar#how-to-bulk-schedule-events-via-csv)

For detailed instructions on how to use the Event Calendar, check out the [Event Calendar Documentation](/live-classes/event-calendar) for step-by-step guidance.
