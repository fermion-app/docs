During [live sessions](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes), instructors can pin a specific participant's tile to ensure all students view the same content simultaneously. This feature is particularly useful when you want to highlight a specific speaker, demonstration, or presentation to the entire class.

## How tiles work

When you pin a tile, it becomes the primary focus for all participants in the live session, overriding their individual view preferences. This ensures everyone stays synchronized and focused on the same content, making it ideal for scenarios like guest lectures, student presentations, or when demonstrating specific concepts.

## Pinning a tile

To pin a tile during a live session, simply hover over the participant's video tile and click the pin icon. The pinned view will immediately apply to all students in the session. You can unpin at any time to return control of the view to individual students.

<Tip>
Only **meeting hosts** have the ability to pin and unpin a participant's tile. This ensures that the session remains organized and all students are focused on the intended content without conflicting views from other participants.
