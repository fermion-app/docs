After your live session is recorded and AI captions are generated, Fermion can automatically create an AI-powered summary of the entire session. This summary provides students with a comprehensive overview of key topics, concepts, and takeaways from the live event, making it easier for them to review and understand the content.

The AI summary is generated based on the transcript of the live session and appears below the video player for easy access. This feature helps students quickly grasp the main points covered during the session without having to watch the entire recording.

**Note:** For AI summary to work, AI captions must be enabled first. The summary is generated automatically once the transcript is available.
