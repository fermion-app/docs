Fermion provides robust content protection mechanisms to safeguard your valuable educational content from unauthorized distribution and piracy. Our platform integrates industry-standard Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology alongside customizable video watermarking features, ensuring your intellectual property remains secure throughout the streaming and playback process.

## Digital Rights Management (DRM)

Fermion's built-in DRM support encrypts your live stream content, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized users to download, record, or redistribute your videos. This enterprise-grade protection works seamlessly across all supported devices and browsers, providing peace of mind while you focus on delivering quality education.

### Key DRM Features

- **Automatic encryption:** All live streams(with DRM enabled) are automatically encrypted using industry-standard protocols
- **Device-level protection:** Content is protected at the hardware level on supported devices
- **Browser compatibility:** Works across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge browsers.
### Enable DRM for your live sessions
1. Go to the **Live events** page on any of your cohort based course.
2. Click on **Edit** next to a live stream or **+Add Session**

## Video Watermarking

In addition to DRM, Fermion offers dynamic video watermarking that overlays unique identifiers on each viewer's stream. This powerful feature acts as a deterrent against content piracy and helps you identify the source of any leaked content.

### How Video Watermarking Works

When enabled, each student viewing your live stream receives a unique watermark containing their user information. This watermark is dynamically generated and cannot be easily removed, making it possible to trace any unauthorized sharing back to the original viewer.

### Watermarking Options

- **User ID watermarking:** Display the student's unique identifier on the video
- **Email watermarking:** Show the registered email address of the viewer
- **Name:** Add users' name as an identifier to the watermark
- **Phone number:** Shows the viewers mobile number.
- **Font size control:** Choose where the watermark appears on the screen
- **Opacity settings:** Adjust watermark visibility to balance security with viewing experience

## Enabling Video Watermarking

To enable video watermarking settings for your school:

1. Go to **Settings** → **School settings** → **Security**
