This document addresses frequently asked questions regarding live class functionality on the Fermion platform.

### Do I need to purchase any external license to conduct live classes?

No external licenses are required to conduct live classes on the Fermion platform. All necessary functionality is included within your Fermion subscription.

### Do I need to link my Zoom or Meet account to Fermion?

No account integration with external video conferencing platforms is required. Fermion provides an integrated solution for conducting live classes.

### How will students be notified of upcoming live classes?

When utilizing Fermion's built-in livestreaming functionality as your primary Learning Management System (LMS), automated notifications are sent to all enrolled students:

-   24 hours prior to the scheduled class
-   30 minutes before the class commencement

For API-based livestreaming implementations, instructors are responsible for managing student notifications manually.

To maximize student participation, we recommend utilizing both the automated notification system and community group announcements for important class updates.
