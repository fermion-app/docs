title: 'Auto-recording & Captions for Live Sessions'
---

Upon completion of your live session, Fermion automatically converts it into a video recording and makes it available to your students. Instructors can opt in to generate AI-powered captions, which are automatically created in the same language used during the live stream.

This feature enhances accessibility for students and makes your content more inclusive. The captions are automatically synchronized with the video timeline and can be toggled on or off by viewers. There is a brief processing time for the recording to be available and for captions to be generated, which depends on factors like the duration of the call, total number of participants, and the number of users on stage.

Additionally, You can make this recording downloadable so your students can access it offline.

To enable recording and captions, follow these steps:
1. Go to Courses
2. Select a cohort-based course
3. Open the Course Builder
4. Navigate to Live events
5. Click Edit on the relevant live event
6. Go to Advanced Settings and
    - Enable the `Allow students to download MP4` option to let students download the recording
    - Enable the `AI Transcripts` option to generate AI Transcripts
