title: 'Auto-recording & Captions for Live Sessions'
---

Upon completion of your live session, Fermion automatically converts it into a video recording and makes it available to your students. Instructors can opt in to generate AI-powered captions, which are automatically created in the same language used during the live stream.

This feature enhances accessibility for students and makes your content more inclusive. The captions are automatically synchronized with the video timeline and can be toggled on or off by viewers. There is a brief processing time for the recording to be available and for captions to be generated, which depends on factors like the duration of the call, total number of participants, and the number of users on stage.

## Accessing Captions via Webhooks

For advanced integrations, you can programmatically access the generated captions through Fermion's webhook system. This allows you to:

- Receive real-time notifications when captions are generated
- Integrate caption data into your own systems or workflows
- Build custom caption viewers or editors
- Archive captions in your preferred storage solution

When a live session's captions are ready, Fermion will send a webhook event to your configured endpoint with the caption data in standard formats (SRT, VTT). This enables seamless automation and integration with your existing tools.

For detailed information on setting up webhooks and handling caption events, refer to our [Webhooks documentation](/webhooks/event-payloads).

Additionally, You can make this recording downloadable so your students can access it offline.
