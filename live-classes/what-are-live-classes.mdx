Fermion offers built-in live streaming capabilities, eliminating the need for third-party applications like Zoom. This not only provides a seamless experience but also reduces additional costs and setup hassles.

Fermion's in-house live streaming infrastructure supports up to 10,000 participants in a live stream, with the option to add 50 people to the stage. This ensures a smooth, uninterrupted teaching experience, making it easier for you to focus on delivering your content effectively.

## What is a Live Class?

A Live Class is an interactive, real-time session between you and your students, powered by Fermion’s in-house streaming infrastructure.
Unlike traditional third-party integrations, Fermion’s live system is deeply integrated into the LMS, giving you full control over every aspect of the experience: from scheduling and access management to recording, playback, and host controls. You can engage your learners through [real-time chat](/live-classes/live-chat), polls, and speaker interactions, while maintaining complete content security with built-in [DRM](/live-classes/drm-and-watermarking) and [analytics](/live-classes/livestream-analytics) tracking.
