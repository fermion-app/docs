Fermion offers built-in live streaming capabilities, eliminating the need for third-party applications like Zoom. This not only provides a seamless experience but also reduces additional costs and setup hassles.

Fermionâ€™s in-house live streaming infrastructure ensures a smooth, uninterrupted teaching experience, making it easier for you to focus on delivering your content effectively.

## Fermion's live infrastructure capabilities

1. **Invite multiple speakers**

Livestreaming on fermion allows you to invite multiple students/teachers on the call. Currently, you can have upto 50 participants on 'Stage', allowing them to screenshare , turn on their microphone and camera to interact and communicate with the participants.

Instructors can also automatically add everyone to the stage(Ideal for smaller live sessions with less than 50 participants) , which will allow seamless communication between a small group of people.

2. **Pin a tile for everyone**

Instructors have the ability to 'PIN' a users tile to the stream, maksing sure that students stay focused on the same view.

3. **Unlimited students**

Our systems are built and tested to support more than 10,000+ students attending your live class at once. That means you get an experience as smooth as butter while teaching, and your students get uninterrupted learning from you.

4. **No limit on duration**

There is no restriction for the number of hours you can go live for. You can even teach for 6+ hours in a setting, all possible on Fermion.

5. **In-built DRM support**

With Fermion's in-build DRM support, your video content is protected from piracy and unauthorised sharing. Additionally, we offer a video watermarking option to identify anyone sharing or pirating your content.

6. **Auto-recordings**

Once your live session is completed, Fermion automatically converts it into a video recording and makes it available to your students.

Note: There is a brief processing time for this recording time to be available to students, which depends on multiple factors like the duration of the call, total number of participats, total number of users on stage,  total number of users sharing their screens / were speaking.

Additionally, you can also make this recording as a downloadable video available to your students for offline access.
