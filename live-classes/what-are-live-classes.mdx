Fermion offers built-in live class capabilities, eliminating the need for third-party applications like Zoom. This not only provides a seamless experience but also reduces additional costs and setup hassles.

Fermionâ€™s in-house infrastructure ensures a smooth, uninterrupted teaching experience, making it easier for you to focus on delivering their content effectively.

## Fermion's live infrastructure capabilities

1. **Invite multiple speakers**

Livestreaming on fermion allows you to invite multiple students/teachers on the call that can screenshare and turn on their microphone, camera right within the browser.

2. **Unlimited students**

Our systems are built and tested to support more than 10,000+ students attending your live class at once. That means you get an experience as smooth as butter while teaching, and your students get uninterrupted learning from you.

3. **No limit on duration**

There is no restriction for the number of hours you can go live for. You can even teach for 6+ hours in a setting, all possible on Fermion.

4. **In-built DRM support**

With Fermion's in-build DRM support, your video content is protected from piracy and unauthorised sharing.

5. **Auto-recordings**

Once your live session is completed, Fermion automatically converts it into a video recording and makes it available to your students.

6. **Chat live with your students**

Send messages, tag people and chat in real-time with your students. You can also manage how many messages users can send in a minute and other controls to smoothly moderate your stream. Conduct polls and weigh in opinions to increase interactivity within your live stream.

7. **Monitor stream analytics**

Built-in stream analytics. See how many students attended the stream, when did they drop off, how many messages were sent and so much more.

8. **White labeled embedding**

You can embed live sessions even outside fermion if you choose to do so with our private API. More on this later.

9. **Upto 1080p session streaming**

Fermion allows you to stream upto 1080p to unlimited viewers, which is later made available as a recording too.
