Fermion offers built-in live streaming capabilities, eliminating the need for third-party applications like Zoom. This not only provides a seamless experience but also reduces additional costs and setup hassles.

Fermionâ€™s in-house live streaming infrastructure ensures a smooth, uninterrupted teaching experience, making it easier for you to focus on delivering your content effectively.

## Fermion's live infrastructure capabilities
Fermion comes with a range of powerful live class features designed to make teaching and learning more interactive, secure, and scalable. Below are some of the key capabilities available to you.
### **Invite multiple speakers**

Livestreaming on fermion allows you to invite multiple students/teachers on the call. Currently, you can have upto 50 participants on 'Stage', allowing them to screenshare , turn on their microphone and camera to interact and communicate with the participants.

Instructors can also automatically add everyone to the stage(Ideal for smaller live sessions with less than 50 participants) , which will allow seamless communication between a small group of people.

### **Pin a tile for everyone**

Instructors have the ability to 'PIN' a users tile to the stream, maksing sure that students stay focused on the same view.
