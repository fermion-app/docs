Fermion's live chat feature enables real-time communication between instructors and students during [live sessions](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes). The chat interface supports rich interactions including direct messaging, user mentions, file attachments, and interactive polls, creating an engaging learning environment where students can actively participate and collaborate.

## High-volume chat 

The chat system is designed to handle high-volume conversations with thousands of participants simultaneously, ensuring smooth communication even in large-scale live sessions. Messages are delivered instantly, allowing for dynamic Q&A sessions, quick clarifications, and spontaneous discussions that enhance the learning experience.

## Instructor and student engagement

Instructors can leverage the chat to gauge student understanding, collect instant feedback, and maintain engagement throughout the session. Students can tag specific participants using @ mentions to direct questions or responses, share relevant files and resources, and participate in polls to provide collective input on topics being discussed.
