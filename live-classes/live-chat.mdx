Fermion's live chat feature enables real-time communication between instructors and students during live sessions. The chat interface supports rich interactions including direct messaging, user mentions, file attachments, and interactive polls, creating an engaging learning environment where students can actively participate and collaborate.

The chat system is designed to handle high-volume conversations with thousands of participants simultaneously, ensuring smooth communication even in large-scale live sessions. Messages are delivered instantly, allowing for dynamic Q&A sessions, quick clarifications, and spontaneous discussions that enhance the learning experience.

Instructors can leverage the chat to gauge student understanding, collect instant feedback, and maintain engagement throughout the session. Students can tag specific participants using @ mentions to direct questions or responses, share relevant files and resources, and participate in polls to provide collective input on topics being discussed.

The chat interface remains accessible throughout the entire live session and can be used alongside other features like screen sharing and stage participation. All chat messages are preserved and can be reviewed after the session ends, providing a valuable reference for both instructors and students.
