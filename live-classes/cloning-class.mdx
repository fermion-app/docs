description: Learn how to clone a live class from one cohort-based course to another in just a few clicks.
---

Cloning a live class allows you to quickly reuse an existing session setup, including the title, timing, and hosts, in another cohort-based course without having to create everything from scratch. It’s a simple way to save time and maintain consistency when running multiple cohorts or repeating sessions for new batches.

<Tip>
You can clone a live event inside another cohort-based-course you have on the platform. This allows you to go live at once in two or more courses.

## Steps to Clone a Live Class

1. Go to **Courses** from your dashboard.
