Cloning a [live class](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes) allows you to quickly reuse an existing session setup, including the title, timing, and hosts, in another [cohort-based course](/setting-up-course/prerequisites#what-is-a-cohort-based-course) without having to create everything from scratch. It’s a simple way to save time and maintain consistency when running multiple cohorts or repeating sessions for new batches.

<Tip>
	You can clone a live event inside another cohort-based course you have on the platform. This
	allows you to go live at once in two or more courses.

## Steps to clone a live class

You can clone a live class from one cohort based course to another with the help of the following steps:

<Steps>

<Step title="Go to Courses">From your dashboard, navigate to the **Courses** section.</Step>

<Step title="Open the cohort-based course">
	Select the **Cohort-based Course** that contains the live class you want to clone. ![Course
	Builder](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/06-10-2025/open%20course%20builder.wfarfd.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Go to the Syllabus section">
	Navigate to the **Syllabus** section of the selected course.
</Step>

<Step title="Open options menu">
	Click the **three dots (⋮)** next to the live class you want to duplicate.
</Step>

<Step title="Select 'Clone in another CBC'">
	Choose **Clone in another CBC** from the dropdown menu. ![Duplicate in
	CBC](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/06-10-2025/syllabus.gcnvyk.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Select target course">
	From the list, select the cohort-based course you want to clone the class to.
</Step>

<Step title="Add the class">
	Click **Add Class in this course** to confirm. ![Add class to
	course](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/06-10-2025/add%20class.mqrkwm.png)
</Step>

</Steps>

Once cloned, the live class will appear in the target course’s syllabus with all its original details intact, including the title, timing, and hosts. Cloning saves time and ensures consistency across multiple cohorts, so you can focus on delivering great sessions rather than recreating content.

<Info>
	Use cloning when running recurring sessions, orientation classes, or live events that need to be
	repeated across multiple courses. It helps maintain a consistent experience for all learners.
