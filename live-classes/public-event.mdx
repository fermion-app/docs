## Overview

[Live Events]() on Fermion can be added inside your **[courses]()**, or hosted as **public sessions** accessible to anyone through a shareable invite link.  
This gives you complete flexibility: teach within a structured course or reach a wider audience with open webinars, bootcamps, and workshops.

## Standalone Invites

Public events can also be shared through **[Standalone Invites](/live-classes/standalone-invites)**, allowing anyone to join your session without enrolling in a course.

Standalone Invites are perfect for:
- **Guest sessions**
- **Workshops**
- **Webinars**
- **Promotional events**

They give you full control over access and visibility, you decide who can join and how they receive their invite.

To learn how to create and manage standalone invites, see the detailed guide here:  
[**Creating Standalone Invites →**](/live-classes/standalone-invites)

## Management settings


Manage how your public live event behaves after setup, including certificates to administrative actions. Head over to the **Settings** tab in your public event sidebar to access these settings.

### Completion certificate
Control whether attendees receive a **certificate of completion** after the live event.  
By default, certificates are **disabled**. Toggle **“Issue certificate of completion”** to enable, then click **Save Changes** to apply.
