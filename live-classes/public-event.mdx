## Overview

[Live Events]() on Fermion can be added inside your **[courses]()**, or hosted as **public sessions** accessible to anyone through a shareable invite link.  
This gives you complete flexibility: teach within a structured course or reach a wider audience with open webinars, bootcamps, and workshops.

## Standalone Invites

Public events can also be shared through **[Standalone Invites](/live-classes/standalone-invites)**, allowing anyone to join your session without enrolling in a course.

Standalone Invites are perfect for:
- **Guest sessions**
- **Workshops**
- **Webinars**
- **Promotional events**

They give you full control over access and visibility, you decide who can join and how they receive their invite.

To learn how to create and manage standalone invites, see the detailed guide here:  
[**Creating Standalone Invites**](/live-classes/standalone-invites)


## Session management

Manage and customize your public event sessions from the **Manage sessions** tab. Here you can configure streaming preferences, event timing, playback permissions, and participant notifications to ensure a seamless viewing experience.
Head over to the **Manage sessions** tab in your product builder to access settings of the public event.

### **Start time**
Displays the scheduled start time for your live session.  
Example: `24 Oct, 2025 – 5:47 PM (Your local timezone)`

### **Estimated event duration**
Set an approximate duration for your session (e.g., one hour). Your session can continue beyond the estimated time without any interruption.

### **Allow recorded playback**
If enabled, participants can rewatch the session recording after it ends. If disabled, playback will be unavailable once the live event concludes. Learn more about [auto-recording](/live-classes/recording-and-captions).

### **Enable reminder emails**
Send automatic reminders to registered participants at key intervals before the event begins:
- 24 hours before the event
- 6 hours before the event
- 30 minutes before the event 

This ensures participants don’t miss your live session.

### **DRM protected playback**
When enabled, playback is secured with DRM protection: preventing screen recording or screenshots (similar to Netflix or Amazon Prime Video). Learn more about [DRM protection](/live-classes/drm-and-watermarking).


<Tip> Please note that DRM usage is billed separately. Head over to [Fermion Pricing](https://fermion.app/pricing) for more information regarding DRM playbacks</Tip>


### External hosts

You can invite additional hosts to help manage your live event.  
Hosts have administrative privileges : including starting or ending the stream, inviting speakers to stage, and moderating participants.

To **add an external host**, perform the following steps:
1. Enter the host’s email address in the **Add a new host** field.  
2. Click **Add** to give the user with this email address host privileges.

## Management settings


Manage how your public live event behaves after setup, including certificates to administrative actions. Head over to the **Settings** tab in your public event sidebar to access these settings.
