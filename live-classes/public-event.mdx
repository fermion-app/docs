## Standalone Invites

Stand-alone invites allow you to share access to your Public Events without requiring students to register for a full course or cohort. They are ideal for special webinars, bootcamps, workshops, guest sessions, or promotional live events.

With stand-alone invites, you can **control access**, **track participation**, and easily **revoke or reactivate** invites as needed. This provides flexibility for both organizers and attendees while keeping your events secure and manageable.

## Create a stand-alone invite for public events

Use stand-alone invites to give participants access to a public live event through a unique link with the help of the following steps:

<Steps>

<Step title="Enable Live Sessions feature">

## Session management


Manage and customize your public event sessions from the **Manage sessions** tab. Here you can configure streaming preferences, event timing, playback permissions, and participant notifications to ensure a seamless viewing experience.
Head over to the **Manage sessions** tab in your product builder to access settings of the public event.

![](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/03-11-2025/chrome_IAkfyyiPxP.hgszfy.png)

### Go live

You can use the **Manage sessions** tab to go live with your public event. Click on the **Go live** button in Stream controls to start the live session

![](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/03-11-2025/chrome_2QeHVdqZ01.gdmvxp.png)

### **Start time**
![](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/20-10-2025/chrome_u4Vw6kOVya.medbiy.png)

Displays the scheduled start time for your live session.  
Example: `24 Oct, 2025 – 5:47 PM (Your local timezone)`

### **Estimated event duration**

Set an approximate duration for your session (e.g., one hour). Your session can continue beyond the estimated time without any interruption.

### **Allow recorded playback**

If enabled, participants can rewatch the session recording after it ends. If disabled, playback will be unavailable once the live event concludes. Learn more about [auto-recording](/live-classes/recording-and-captions).

### **Enable reminder emails**

Send automatic reminders to registered participants at key intervals before the event begins:

-   24 hours before the event
-   6 hours before the event
-   30 minutes before the event

This ensures participants don’t miss your live session.

### **DRM protected playback**

When enabled, playback is secured with DRM protection: preventing screen recording or screenshots (similar to Netflix or Amazon Prime Video). Learn more about [DRM protection](/live-classes/drm-and-watermarking).

<Tip>
	{' '}
	Please note that DRM usage is billed separately. Head over to [Fermion Pricing](https://fermion.app/pricing)
	for more information regarding DRM playbacks
</Tip>

### External hosts

You can invite additional hosts to help manage your live event.  
Hosts have administrative privileges : including starting or ending the stream, inviting speakers to stage, and moderating participants.

To **add an external host**, perform the following steps:

1. Enter the host’s email address in the **Add a new host** field.
2. Click **Add** to give the user with this email address host privileges.

## Pricing & Coupon Codes

You can set fixed prices, discounted prices, and manage regional pricing if applicable.

You can also apply coupon codes to public events, similar to other products.  
This allows you to offer limited-time deals or special access promotions.
