The **Whiteboard** in [live sessions](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes) is a collaborative visual canvas designed to make teaching and demonstrations more interactive and engaging. It allows instructors to visually explain concepts, sketch diagrams, highlight content, and respond to student questions in real time.

## Why do we need whiteboard?

Visual explanations often communicate ideas more effectively than text or speech alone. By combining the power of drawing, writing, and pointing, instructors can create an immersive learning environment that promotes clarity and real-time understanding. This makes it an essential tool for instructors who prefer to demonstrate thought processes and encourage participation.

<Check>Only instructors have the opportunity to use the whiteboard, while students can point and draw laser markers to direct the instructor’s attention toward specific parts of the board. This ensures controlled collaboration and prevents interruptions while keeping sessions highly interactive.</Check>

## Accessing the whiteboard

You can access the whiteboard directly from your [live session](/live-classes/setup-live-class) interface. Once inside a session, it takes only a few clicks to begin sketching and collaborating visually.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Join a live session">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Student interaction">
    Students can follow your whiteboard in real time and use their laser pointers to draw attention to specific areas.  
    However, they cannot modify or erase the content on the instructor’s board.

The whiteboard transforms traditional online teaching into a truly collaborative experience. It helps bridge the gap between theory and visualization, especially in technical or design-oriented classes. With live annotations, instructors can illustrate problem-solving metho

<Tip>
**Make sure to pin your whiteboard tile** if you’re also screen sharing.  
This ensures the whiteboard remains the **primary visible content** for all participants throughout the session.

## Features

The whiteboard offers a powerful and fluid real-time drawing experience, purpose-built for teaching, visual explanation, and team collaboration. Every stroke, object, and annotation is synchronized instantly across all participants, ensuring that both instructors and learners stay perfectly in sync.

### Infinite canvas

The whiteboard provides an **infinite canvas**, allowing instructors to think and teach without boundaries. You can scroll, pan, and zoom effortlessly to create multiple segments of your explanation within a single continuous space. This is especially helpful when breaking down large problems, such as multi-step algorithms or design diagrams.

### Drawing tools and shapes

The drawing toolkit offers an intuitive experience for freehand sketches and structured shapes. You can draw using pen tools, create rectangles, circles, arrows, and even straight lines to depict flowcharts, system architectures, or visual examples.  

Each element drawn can be resized and repositioned, providing full creative freedom while maintaining precision. The pen input is optimized for fluid motion and minimal latency, so it feels as natural as writing on a real whiteboard.

### Text and annotations

In addition to drawing, you can insert **text boxes** anywhere on the canvas. This allows instructors to label diagrams, write notes, or define key terms without cluttering the visual explanation. Text elements can be styled with varying sizes and colors, making it easy to differentiate headings, definitions, and supporting notes.

Annotations appear instantly across all participant screens, enabling everyone to follow the instructor’s reasoning in real time.

### Color and styling controls

To enhance visual clarity, the whiteboard includes a **color palette and styling controls**. You can switch between pen colors, adjust line thickness, and change fill properties for shapes. This flexibility helps highlight important sections, differentiate between concepts, and make diagrams more visually coherent.

Using multiple colors not only improves engagement but also reinforces visual learning by emphasizing relationships between different ideas.

### Upload images onto whiteboard

Instructors can **upload images directly onto the whiteboard**, making it easier to build lessons around pre-existing visual materials. You can import diagrams, screenshots, infographics, or reference materials and annotate them live to enhance understanding.

![](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/16-10-2025/chrome_13qZecq4Pz.aytvwn.png)

Uploading an image is as simple as selecting the **image icon** from the toolbar and choosing a file from your device. Once placed on the canvas, you can **resize** or **reposition** the image freely. This flexibility allows you to blend pre-prepared visuals with spontaneous drawings and notes.


### Real-time collaboration

Every interaction on the whiteboard: drawing, typing, or moving an object, is synchronized live. This real-time sync ensures that students see the instructor’s content evolve instantly, stroke by stroke, with zero noticeable delay.  

<Check>Students can’t draw on the instructor’s board but can use laser pointers to guide attention toward specific areas, ask questions, or highlight doubts without disrupting the flow of teaching.</Check>

This controlled interactivity promotes focus and engagement, giving students the ability to interact meaningfully while maintaining instructional control.

### Undo, redo, and erase

Mistakes are part of the creative process, and the whiteboard makes correcting them simple. The undo **[CTRL/CMD + Z]** and redo **[CTRL/CMD + Shift + Z]**  actions allow you to step backward or forward through your edits. The **eraser tool** provides precise control for removing unwanted strokes or shapes without affecting the
