The `getFile()` method retrieves a file from your sandbox’s filesystem and returns it as a standard **Web Response object**, allowing you to handle the data in multiple formats: text, JSON, binary, or Blob.

All file paths must start with `~` or the absolute path `/home/damner/code` to ensure access is confined to the sandbox’s isolated workspace. If the requested file doesn’t exist or the path is invalid, an error is thrown.
