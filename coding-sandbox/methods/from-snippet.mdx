The `fromSnippet()` method allows you to reconnect to a previously created **persistent sandbox** using its unique snippet ID. This is useful when you’ve created a sandbox with `shouldBackupFilesystem: true` and want to resume work without losing files or progress.  

When invoked, `fromSnippet()` re-establishes the session, restores the container’s filesystem, and reconnects the WebSocket channel for live command execution. It behaves identically to a freshly created sandbox:except that your files, environment state, and project data are preserved. This makes it ideal for long-lived development environments, user projects, or build processes that span multiple sessions.  

Use this method whenever you need to restore a saved environment by referencing the snippet ID returned from a previous `create()` call.

## `fromSnippet(playgroundSnippetId)`


**Description:**
Connects to an existing sandbox using its snippet ID. Use this to reconnect to a sandbox that was created with `shouldBackupFilesystem: true`.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| playgroundSnippetId | string |  Yes | The snippet ID returned from a previous `create()` call |

**Returns:**
`Promise<void>` - Resolves when connection is established

**Example:**
```typescript
// Session 1: Create persistent sandbox
const snippetId = await sandbox1.create({
  shouldBackupFilesystem: true
})
await sandbox1.writeFile({ path: '~/data.txt', content: 'saved' })
await sandbox1.disconnect()

// Session 2: Reconnect later
const sandbox2 = new Sandbox({ apiKey: 'key' })
await sandbox2.fromSnippet(snippetId)
const file = await sandbox2.getFile('~/data.txt')
console.log(await file.text()) // 'saved'
```

**Throws:**
- `Error: "Provisioning timeout"` - Container took too long to start
- `Error: "Cannot get new session"` - Snippet not found or no longer available
- `Error: "WebSocket already connected"` - Already connected to a sandbox

**Notes:**
- Only works with snippets created with `shouldBackupFilesystem: true`
- Old snippets may be deleted after inactivity period (document retention policy)
