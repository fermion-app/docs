The `create()` method provisions a brand-new sandbox container within Fermion’s secure cloud infrastructure. When invoked, it initializes a clean Linux environment, configures your session, and establishes a WebSocket connection for real-time communication. Depending on the options you pass, the sandbox can be either **ephemeral** (short-lived and automatically destroyed on disconnect) or **persistent** (saved for later use).  

You can also clone a Git repository during provisioning, making it easy to start from existing codebases or templates. The process typically completes within a few seconds, after which the sandbox is ready to accept commands, file operations, or server executions. The method returns a unique `snippetId`, which you can store and reuse to reconnect to the same environment later.


## `create(options)`

**Description:**
Creates and provisions a new sandbox container. This process includes:
1. Creating a playground snippet
2. Starting a session
3. Waiting for container provisioning (polling with 500ms intervals)
4. Establishing WebSocket connection
5. Waiting for container server to be ready
6. Optionally cloning a git repository

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| shouldBackupFilesystem | boolean | Yes | - | If true, files persist after disconnect. If false, everything is deleted. |
| gitRepoUrl | string |  No | undefined | GitHub/GitLab repository URL to clone on startup |

**Returns:**
`Promise<string>` - Resolves with the playground snippet ID (save this to start another container with same file system later)

**Example:**
```typescript
// Basic ephemeral sandbox
const snippetId = await sandbox.create({
  shouldBackupFilesystem: false
})

// Persistent sandbox
const snippetId = await sandbox.create({
  shouldBackupFilesystem: true
})
console.log('Save this ID:', snippetId)

// With git repository
const snippetId = await sandbox.create({
  shouldBackupFilesystem: true,
  gitRepoUrl: 'https://github.com/username/repo.git'
})
```
