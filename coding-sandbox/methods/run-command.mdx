The `runCommand()` method executes a single short-lived command inside your active sandbox container and waits until it finishes before returning the output. It’s ideal for quick tasks that complete within a few seconds: such as listing directories, checking Node.js or Python versions, or running lightweight scripts.  

This method runs the command synchronously and captures both `stdout` and `stderr` once the execution is complete. Because it is optimized for speed and simplicity, `runCommand()` has a strict 5-second execution limit and does not support streaming output.


### `runCommand(options)`

**Description:**
Executes a short command (< 5 seconds) and waits for completion. For longer operations, use `runStreamingCommand()`.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| cmd | string | Yes | Command to execute (e.g., 'node', 'python', 'ls') |
| args | string[] |  No | Array of command arguments |

**Returns:**
```typescript
Promise<{
  stdout: string  // Standard output
  stderr: string  // Standard error
}>
```

**Example:**
```typescript
// Simple command
const result = await sandbox.runCommand({
  cmd: 'pwd'
})
console.log('Current dir:', result.stdout)
```

**Limitations:**
- **5 second maximum** : Command will timeout
- No streaming - must wait for completion
- No exit code returned (use `runStreamingCommand` if you need it)
