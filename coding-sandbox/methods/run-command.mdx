The `runCommand()` method executes a single short-lived command inside your active sandbox container and waits until it finishes before returning the output. It’s ideal for quick tasks that complete within a few seconds: such as listing directories, checking Node.js or Python versions, or running lightweight scripts.  

This method runs the command synchronously and captures both `stdout` and `stderr` once the execution is complete. Because it is optimized for speed and simplicity, `runCommand()` has a strict 5-second execution limit and does not support streaming output. For longer-running or real-time operations, you should use [runStreamingCommand()](/coding-sandbox/methods/run-streaming-command) instead.  

In essence, `runCommand()` is your go-to choice for fast, non-interactive shell commands that produce immediate output without requiring continuous monitoring.


### `runCommand(options)`

**Description:**
Executes a short command (< 5 seconds) and waits for completion. Use this for quick operations like `ls`, `pwd`, `cat`, or fast scripts. For longer operations, use `runStreamingCommand()`.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| cmd | string | Yes | Command to execute (e.g., 'node', 'python', 'ls') |
| args | string[] |  No | Array of command arguments |

**Returns:**
```typescript
Promise<{
  stdout: string  // Standard output
  stderr: string  // Standard error
}>
```

**Example:**
```typescript
// Simple command
const result = await sandbox.runCommand({
  cmd: 'pwd'
})
console.log('Current dir:', result.stdout)

// With arguments
const result = await sandbox.runCommand({
  cmd: 'ls',
  args: ['-la', '/home/damner/code']
})
console.log(result.stdout)

// Node script
const result = await sandbox.runCommand({
  cmd: 'node',
  args: ['--version']
})
console.log('Node:', result.stdout.trim())
```

**Throws:**
- `Error: "Not connected"` : Must call `create()` or `fromSnippet()` first
- `Error: "Unexpected response event type"` - Internal protocol error (rare)
- Timeout if command runs longer than 5 seconds

**Limitations:**
- **5 second maximum** : Command will timeout
- No streaming - must wait for completion
- No exit code returned (use `runStreamingCommand` if you need it)

**When to Use:**
- File listings (`ls`)
- Quick scripts (`node script.js` under 5s)
- Path operations (`pwd`, `cd && pwd`)
- Reading small files (`cat file.txt`)

**When NOT to Use:**
-  Package installation (`npm install`)
-  Building projects (`npm run build`)
-  Long-running servers
-  Large file operations
