Before you can create or manage containers, you must first initialize the Fermion Sandbox client. The `Sandbox({ apiKey })` constructor establishes a secure connection between your application and Fermion’s backend infrastructure, authenticating every subsequent operation you perform. This step does not immediately spin up a container, instead, it prepares the client instance for later actions such as creating new sandboxes, reconnecting to saved sessions, or running commands. Supplying a valid API key is mandatory, as it ensures that all sandbox operations are securely tied to your account and usage environment.


### `new Sandbox({ apiKey })`

**Description:**
Creates a new Sandbox client instance. This does not create a container yet - call `create()` or `fromSnippet()` after initialization.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| apiKey | string | Yes | Your Fermion API key from the dashboard |

**Returns:**
`Sandbox` instance

**Example:**
```typescript
import { Sandbox } from '@fermion-app/sandbox'

const sandbox = new Sandbox({
  apiKey: process.env.FERMION_API_KEY
})
```

**Throws:**
- Error if apiKey is null, undefined, or empty string
