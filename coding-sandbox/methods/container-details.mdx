The `getContainerDetails()` method provides low-level connection information for the currently active sandbox container. It returns an object containing the **container subdomain** and a **playground access token**, which are used internally to establish and manage secure communication between your client and the Fermion infrastructure.  

If there is no active connection, for instance, before `create()` is called or after `disconnect()`- this method returns `null`. While this data can be useful for debugging, advanced integrations, or monitoring session details, it should be handled with extreme care.  

The access token grants privileged access to the container and should **never** be exposed in logs, user interfaces, or shared externally. Always treat it as a secret and avoid persisting it outside secure server-side environments.
