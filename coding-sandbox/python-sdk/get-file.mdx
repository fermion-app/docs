The `get_file()` method retrieves a file from your sandbox's filesystem and returns its contents.  
Depending on the type of file, you can read the data as **text**, **binary bytes**, or even parse it as **JSON**.

All file paths must start with the absolute path `/home/damner` to ensure access is limited to the sandbox's isolated workspace.  
If the requested file doesn't exist or the path is invalid, an error will be raised.

### `async get_file(path: str) -> httpx.Response`

**Description:**  
Retrieves a file from the sandbox filesystem. Returns an `httpx.Response` object that you can use to read the content as text, bytes, or parse as JSON.

---

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type  | Required | Default | Description                                |
| --------- | ----- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `path`    | `str` | Yes      | —       | File path (must start with `/home/damner`) |

---

**Returns:**  
`httpx.Response`: Response object with the following methods:

-   `.text` - Read as string (property)
-   `.content` - Read as bytes (property)
-   `.read()` - Read as bytes (method)
-   `.json()` - Parse as JSON (method)

Raises an exception if the file does not exist or the path is invalid.

**Examples**

```python
import asyncio
from fermion_sandbox import Sandbox

async def main():
    sandbox = Sandbox(api_key="your-api-key")
    await sandbox.create(should_backup_filesystem=True)

    # Read a Python file as text
    response = await sandbox.get_file("/home/damner/script.py")
    content = response.text
    print(content)

    # Read a binary file
    response = await sandbox.get_file("/home/damner/data.bin")
    binary_data = response.content

    # Read and parse JSON
    response = await sandbox.get_file("/home/damner/config.json")
    config = response.json()

asyncio.run(main())
```
