The `get_file()` method retrieves a file from your sandbox’s filesystem and returns its contents.  
Depending on the type of file, you can read the data as **text**, **binary bytes**, or even parse it as **JSON**.

All file paths must start with `~` or the absolute path `/home/damner/code` to ensure access is limited to the sandbox’s isolated workspace.  
If the requested file doesn’t exist or the path is invalid, an error will be raised.

### `get_file(path: str) -> Union[str, bytes]`

**Description:**  
Retrieves a file from the sandbox filesystem. Returns its content either as a decoded string (`str`) or raw binary (`bytes`).

---

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|------------|------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | `str` | Yes | — | File path (must start with `~` or `/home/damner/code`) |

---

**Returns:**  
`str` or `bytes`: File content.  
Raises an exception if the file does not exist or the path is invalid.
The response object has the following methods:
- `.text()` - Read as string
- `.arrayBuffer()` - Read as binary
- `.blob()` - Read as Blob
- `.json()` - Parse as JSON

**Examples**

```python
from fermion_sandbox import Sandbox

sandbox = Sandbox(api_key="your-api-key")
sandbox.create(should_backup_filesystem=True)

# Read a Python file
content = sandbox.get_file("~/script.py")
print(content)
