<Update label="October 2025">

## Share system audio during live streams
You can now share your system audio while presenting in a live class. This allows you to broadcast audio from videos, music, or any application on your computer directly to all participants. When you click **Share screen** in a live session, select a window or tab and enable the **Share system audio** option. This is especially useful for sharing video clips or any content where audio is important. For more details, see [Sharing system audio](/live-classes/invite-to-stage#sharing-system-audio).


## Event calendar
The **Event Calendar** brings all your live sessions and events together in one place, making it easy to plan, schedule, and manage live classes. You can view all upcoming sessions, check for overlaps, and make quick adjustments directly from your dashboard.

**Key features:**
- Access the Event Calendar from the instructor dashboard under the **Live** section.
- Schedule individual live sessions by clicking on a date and filling in session details.
- Bulk schedule multiple sessions at once by uploading a CSV file with session information.
- Download a sample CSV from the Bulk Schedule interface to ensure correct formatting.
- Each session can include details like course, section, title, start time, duration, and co-hosts.

For more details, see [Event Calendar](/live-classes/event-calendar).

## Custom checkout fields
You can now collect additional information from learners during checkout using **Custom Checkout Fields**. Add text inputs or dropdowns to your course checkout forms, configure required fields, and export responses with sales data or access them via webhooks. Please refer to [Custom Checkout Fields](/setup-pricing/checkout-fields) for more information.


## Custom links in user dashboard.
  Instructors can now add **custom links** to the User Dashboard sidebar.
    - Configure them under **Settings → User Dashboard → Sidebar Custom Links**.

<Update label="September 2025">
  ## Video transcripts
  Instructors can now opt-in to have both their live sessions and recorded videos transcribed. Captions are natively generated in the same audio language that is being used in the video / live session.
  This option can be enabled for your entire school from :
    - For recorded videos: Settings → School settings → Recorded video settings
    - For Live sessions: Settings → School settings → Livestreaming settings
  For more information, refer to: [Live transcripts](/live-classes/recording-and-captions) & [Recorded video transcripts](/recorded-videos/captions)

  Additionally, this option can also be toggled on a per-stream and per-video basis directly from the session manager and video settings respectively.

  Fermion Pro members have 5 hours of transcription included and Fermion Pro+ members have 50 hours of transcription included in their plan. Any additional transcriptions are charged at 0.3$/hour.
  Please refer to [Fermion Pricing](https://fermion.app/pricing).

  ## Forms v2
  We've completely revamped forms on the platform allowing organizations to build multi‑step forms that can capture detailed information from users, feedback and much more. You can also share forms as public links outside of your organization, customize fields, require answers, add descriptions and cover images, then publish when ready. For more information, please refer to: [Forms](/forms/introduction)

  ## Livestreaming updates
  Instructors can pin a tile for everyone so all students stay focused on the same view: [Pin a tile](/live-classes/pin-a-tile)
  Instructors now have an option where they can automatically add everyone to the stage (Ideal for smaller live sessions with less than 50 participants) , which will allow seamless communication between a small group of people: [Stage](/live-classes/stage)

## Authentication API endpoint
  Creates a login link for a user to log in directly to your Fermion‑managed LMS. Useful when you have your own system and want seamless SSO‑like access.

  ### Why this is useful
  - Seamless hand‑off from your existing app/portal: generate a link server‑side and redirect users into the LMS without an extra login step.
  - Passwordless onboarding: include the link in welcome emails/SMS to let invited users jump straight into their course.
  - Post‑purchase experience: after checkout on your site, deep‑link users directly into the relevant product area in the LMS.
  - Legacy migrations: move users from another system and let them access content before setting/resetting a Fermion password.
  - Mobile apps: open the link from your mobile client to bootstrap a signed‑in web session.
  For more information, please refer to:[API Docs](/api-reference/user/get-login-link-for-user)

  ## Email & Analytics
  Added an email logs dashboard so instructors can access all emails sent out from their School.

  You can access this from the Settings → School Settings option in your sidebar: [email log](/manage-settings/email-log)
