  - Instructors now have an option where they can automatically add everyone to the stage (Ideal for smaller live sessions with less than 50 participants) , which will allow seamless communication between a small group of people.

## Authentication API — 18 September 2025
  - Creates a login link for a user to log in directly to your Fermion‑managed LMS. Useful when you have your own system and want seamless SSO‑like access.

  ### Endpoint
  - Method: POST
  - Authentication: `FERMION-API-KEY` header is required
  - Rate limit: Maximum 60 requests in a 1m window

  ### Why this is useful
  - Seamless hand‑off from your existing app/portal: generate a link server‑side and redirect users into the LMS without an extra login step.
  - Passwordless onboarding: include the link in welcome emails/SMS to let invited users jump straight into their course.
  - Post‑purchase experience: after checkout on your site, deep‑link users directly into the relevant product area in the LMS.
  - Legacy migrations: move users from another system and let them access content before setting/resetting a Fermion password.
  - Mobile apps: open the link from your mobile client to bootstrap a signed‑in web session.

  ### Response
  ```json
  [
    {
      "output": {
        "status": "ok",
        "data": {
          "loginUrl": "<string>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

  ### cURL example
  ```bash
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://backend.codedamn.com/api/public/get-login-link-for-user \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'FERMION-API-KEY: <api-key>' \
    --data '{
    "data": [
      {
        "data": {
          "userIdentifier": {
            "type": "email",
            "email": "jsmith@example.com"
          },

  ## Streamline your URL management with custom redirects

  `Custom redirects` give you complete control over URL redirections within your platform so you can easily maintain and manage URL structures.

  You can:

  - Create exact path matches for precise URL control or create wildcard matches.
  - Set up static pathname or URL redirects
  - Manage multiple redirects from a central dashboard
  - Instant publishing and unpublishing capabilities

  Custom redirects are particularly useful for updating URLs while maintaining existing links, creating shorter paths to specific pages, and managing seasonal or temporary redirects, all while ensuring seamless navigation after content restructuring.

  You can read more about setting up custom redirects in our documentation: [Custom redirects](/custom-landing-pages/custom-redirects).

  ## Add free previews to your course

  Your online courses can now support free previews on specific course items for your students. `Free preview` means that users will be able to access the item without purchasing or logging into the platform.

  You can enable or disable free previews for `articles` inside your course items. Learn more about enabling free previews in the documentation.

  ---

  ## Gamify the learning experience for your students

  You can now manage and customize how gamification should work on your platform. Head over to `Gamification` tab from your Fermion dashboard, where you can control various toolings including:

  - Enabling custom XP rewards on various actions (completing a coding lab, watching a video, finishing a quiz, etc).
  - Adding negative XP to discourage users from performing certain actions, for example: downloading solutions inside a coding lab.
  - Enabling custom XP rewards for students, as a part of “daily attendance” on the platform as well as live classes.
  - Configuring XP rewards for `platform streaks`.

  To set up gamification controls for your school, read [our documentation].
