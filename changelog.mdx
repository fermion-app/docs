## Enhanced live stream recording controls

We've added new options to improve the quality and focus of your live stream recordings and participant views:

- **Hide tiles with no media in recording**: When enabled, participants who have both their camera and microphone turned off will not appear in session recordings when a screen or specific content is pinned. This helps create cleaner, more focused recordings by eliminating empty or inactive video tiles, ensuring viewers see only active speakers and shared content. Participants who turn on their camera or microphone will automatically reappear in the recording.

- **Hide tiles with no media**: This option hides participants with both camera and microphone off from your view when a screen or content is pinned, helping you focus on active participants during live sessions.

These settings can be configured from the **Settings** menu during a live session under the **General** tab. For more information, see [Livestream Settings](/live-classes/livestream-settings).

## Remove host privileges during live sessions

Instructors can now revoke host privileges from other hosts during live sessions.
