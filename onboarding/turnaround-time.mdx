This section explains how Fermion handles issues, from bugs to feature requests, and outlines the expected response and resolution times, along with the escalation process.

## Support turnaround time and escalations

At Fermion, we prioritize addressing issues promptly and keeping you informed every step of the way. For bugs, our response and resolution times depend on the severity of the problem:

<Accordion title="Critical">
  Critical issues, such as the platform being down or a major feature failing, are acknowledged immediately, with a resolution target of within **12 hours**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="High">
  High-priority issues that affect core workflows are typically resolved within **2–3 days**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Low">
  Low-priority issues, such as minor inconveniences or UI/UX concerns, are usually addressed within **1–2 weeks**.
</Accordion>

## Feature requests

New feature requests are acknowledged within **12 hours** of submission. Each request is reviewed and prioritized during our **daily product roadmap discussions**, and the implementation timeline depends on factors such as complexity, feasibility, and existing workload. 


This structured approach ensures that all issues are handled efficiently and escalated appropriately, giving you confidence in timely support and clear communication.
