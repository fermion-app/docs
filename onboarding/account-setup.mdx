## Introduction

Welcome to Fermion! This section will guide you through everything you need to know to get started with your account and set up your first course.
Fermion offers a robust platform with a wide range of features, including recorded and cohort based courses, live classes, coding labs, forms, analytics, 
and white-labeled accounts for a fully branded experience.  

All account setup and configurations - including custom domains and whitelabeling are performed only on **production-level accounts**. If you are currently on a trial account, 
our team will seamlessly transition your account to a production environment once you subscribe to a plan, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience.  

## Account Setup

Setting up an account on Fermion is quick and straightforward. Typically, the entire process takes **30–40 minutes** and is 
handled by the Fermion team, so you can start exploring the platform without any technical hurdles. 
By the end of this process, you will have access to your dashboard under your own branded domain (if applicable) 
and be ready to create and manage your courses efficiently.  

As soon as the account is set up, our team will reach to you over WhatsApp and provide the relevant details for you to access the platform. 
We recommend that you go through the [Platform Resources](/onboarding/platform-resources) to ensure a smooth start at Fermion


Once your account is ready, you can log in to your personalized dashboard where 
you’ll manage courses, coding labs, live sessions, billing, school settings, and more.
