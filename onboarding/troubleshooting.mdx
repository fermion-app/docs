Fermion is built to be reliable, but we know that technical or operational challenges can sometimes arise.  
This section is designed as your first stop for resolving common issues on your own, with clear documentation, 
step-by-step guides, and demo videos to help you get back on track quickly without waiting for support.  

## Troubleshooting Resources

If you’re just getting started, the [Fermion Documentation](https://docs.fermion.app) is the best place to begin.  
It contains detailed guides, FAQs, and configuration instructions covering everything from course setup to advanced platform features.  

We also recommend watching our [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b31PJRfuqc), which provides an overview of the onboarding process, 
core features, and setup best practices. This video is especially helpful if you’re new to Fermion and want a quick walkthrough of how things work.  

For more specific issues, such as recorded videos not playing, buffering, or showing access restrictions, 
we have a dedicated [Video Streaming Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.fermion.app/recorded-videos/troubleshooting-playback).  
This guide walks you through common causes of playback errors and provides practical steps to resolve them.

## When to reach out

Our goal is to empower you to solve problems independently wherever possible. That’s why we’re continuously expanding our troubleshooting library across all key features, 
including account setup, course creation, payments, live sessions, and mobile access. Each guide outlines common problems, their causes, and step-by-step solutions.  

If you ever run into an issue that isn’t covered in the documentation, you can always reach out to our support team with the help of **WhatsApp** channel or you can email us at **support@fermion.app**
