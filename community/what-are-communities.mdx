To give a great learning experience to your students, it is important to bring your community under your platform. [Fermion](https://fermion.app/) offers you a sweet spot - one where you can host your community in a slack-like interface under your domain. Real-time communities on Fermion are your own private space where you can interact with your online audience. The community experience at Fermion is very similar to how Slack works. It comes with tons of features to give your audience a rich experience.

### What's special?

These features which give your audience a rich experience make the community so special. It's a unique blend with your platform and Slack, bringing a native white-labeled community inside your platform.
