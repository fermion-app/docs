The **Legal Settings** section helps you define the legal and compliance documents that govern how users interact with your school.  
Here, administrators can edit and publish the **Terms of Service** and **Privacy Policy** directly from the dashboard using a rich text editor.

Keeping these documents updated ensures compliance with data protection laws and maintains trust with learners and instructors.

## Terms of Service

Define the rules, obligations, and acceptable use guidelines for your school’s platform.

A **Terms of Service (ToS)** sets clear expectations between your school and its users. It protects your organization from misuse, defines user rights, and outlines your liability limits.

### Why ToS matters
- **Legal protection**: Limits your liability for user-generated content and misuse.  
- **Transparency**: Ensures users understand your rules, refund policies, and acceptable behavior.  
- **Enforceability**: Provides a framework for dispute resolution.  
- **Professionalism**: Builds user confidence by showing operational integrity.

<Info>
Your Terms of Service will be publicly accessible at **`/terms-of-service`** on your school’s website.

### Editing your ToS
The editor supports **rich text formatting**, allowing you to:
- Style text (bold, italics, headings, lists)
- Insert **images** and **hyperlinks**
- Add **markdown** or **code blocks**
- Embed relevant media or sections

## Privacy Policy

The **Privacy Policy** defines how your school collects, stores, and uses user data.  
It is a legal requirement in most jurisdictions and helps you maintain compliance with laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and India’s DPDP Act.
