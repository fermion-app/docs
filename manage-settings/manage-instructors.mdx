You can manage your school's instructors by navigating to **Dashboard > School settings > Manage instructors**.

![Manage Instructors](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/10-10-2025/Arc_qvLVOJgtX6.kxtagy.png)

On this page, you can **add new instructors** or **revoke permissions** for existing ones.

By default, every new instructor is created with full (super admin) access to your school. However, you can customize each instructor’s permissions using granular preset options divided into three categories:

To edit permissions for an instructor, please click on `Edit permissions` next to their instructor name.

## Permission presets

**Permission presets** on Fermion are designed to give you fine control over what each instructor can do within your school. Below is an explanation of the main categories and options:

### Courses
You can allow an instructor to manage only specific courses, or grant them broader course administration rights:
- **Single course access:** Instructor can manage only one specific course. They can edit content, enroll students, and handle discussions for that course, but will not see or affect other courses.
- **All course admin (no delete):** Instructor can edit, manage, and update all courses but cannot delete any course. This is suitable if you want them to help maintain content but prevent accidental (or unauthorized) removal.
- **All course admin:** Instructor has full admin rights for all courses, including the ability to create, update, or delete any course. This level should be reserved for highly trusted staff.

### Contest
Control instructor access to contest management features:
- **Single contest access:** Instructor can oversee and manage a single contest. They can set questions, monitor participation, and update settings for that contest only.
- **Single contest access (read only):** Instructor can only view information and analytics for one specific contest. They cannot edit or manage any contest settings.
- **Manage all contests:** Instructor can create, edit, and manage all contests on your school, from setting up problems to analyzing student performance.

### Miscellaneous
These settings cover access to other areas and advanced administrative features:
- **All live events admin:** Instructor can create, edit, and manage all live classes and events in your school, including scheduling, invitations, and control during the actual live session.
- **Video library access:** Instructor can access the full video library, allowing them to upload, edit, or manage video resources shared with your students.
- **Coding labs access:** Instructor can create and manage coding labs, oversee submissions, and monitor student engagement in these interactive environments.
- **Billing access:** Instructor can view and manage billing information, including invoices, payments, and usage statistics. Sensitive—assign only when needed.
- **Developer access:** Instructor can access developer settings like API keys, webhooks, advanced integrations, and platform-level configurations.
- **Read-only super admin:** Instructor can view all school settings, student data, and analytics but cannot make changes anywhere in the system. Useful for oversight or auditing.

Adjust these settings to provide the right level of access for each instructor. This helps you keep your school secure and ensures that instructors can only manage the areas they're responsible for.

From this page, you can also manually edit certain details of an instructor profile, such as their **name**, **profile picture**, **tagline**, and **long description**.

This makes it easy to update an instructor’s public information—useful if someone’s bio changes or you want to add context to their instructor profile.
