You can configure the following options in this section:

## Post-payment success custom page URL

Redirect users to a custom webpage after they complete a successful payment.

- **Usage:** Enter the URL of a page you’ve designed within your school’s website (e.g., a “Thank you” or “Next steps” page).  
- **Benefit:** Helps you personalize post-purchase experiences, promote upsells, or guide students to their first lesson.

<Tip>
Example URL: `https://myschool.fermion.app/thank-you`  
This page could include a welcome message, enrollment details, or a link to the user’s dashboard.

## Physical Office Address

Add your **official business or school address** for compliance and email deliverability.

- **Purpose:** Many countries require a valid business address in transactional emails.  
- **Display:** The address appears in automated communications such as payment receipts, invoices, and notifications.

<Note>
We recommend using your organization’s registered address.  
If you operate remotely, a valid virtual or correspondence address can also be used for compliance.
</Note>

## Custom Code Injection

Insert **custom JavaScript or CSS** globally across your school’s website to modify behavior, add widgets, or customize design elements.

- **Usage:** Ideal for adding analytics scripts (e.g., Google Analytics, Meta Pixel), live chat widgets, or visual styling tweaks.
- **Scope:** Injected code applies across all public-facing pages of your school.

<Check>
Ensure your code snippets are secure and tested to avoid breaking core functionality.  
Improper or unverified third-party scripts can impact load times or security.

These dynamic “Recent sales” alerts appear automatically as users browse your site, enhancing engagement and driving more enrollments. This feature can be enabled on both your home page and [Course Landing Pages](/setting-up-course/landing-page).

This feature can increase engagement and conversion rates, especially during limited-time promotions or course launches.
