The earnings dashboard gives you a complete picture of how your sales evolve over time. It automatically aggregates revenue from all your products, including [courses](/setting-up-course/prerequisites), [bundles](/setting-up-course/bundle), or [digital products](/digital-products/introduction), and displays them in a clear, date-based chart. This helps you visualize your earning patterns, track daily or weekly performance, and identify trends such as spikes in sales during promotions or new course launches. 

Along with visual insights, the dashboard provides detailed figures like total sales count, total revenue in a selected date range, and transaction summaries. These numbers update automatically as new sales occur, giving you real-time insights without needing to refresh or recalculate anything manually.
