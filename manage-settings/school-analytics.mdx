Fermion provides comprehensive analytics for your school, allowing you to track metrics, student activities, and bandwidth usage in one place.

## Overview of Analytics Features

School analytics allow you to monitor:

- **Bandwidth Consumed:** Displays total outbound bandwidth used by your school across all content—useful for understanding traffic and ensuring you stay within limits.
- **Storage Usage:** Track how much storage space your uploaded videos, files, and resources are using.
- **Page Views & Visitors:** View daily/monthly trends for views on your school, and track unique visitors to understand activity and outreach.
- **Coding Lab Hours:** See the total hours spent by students in coding sandboxes or code labs—useful for monitoring student engagement and infrastructure usage.
- **DSA Lab Runs:** Shows how many times students have executed Data Structure & Algorithms (DSA) challenges or labs.
- **Emails Sent:** Track the number of outgoing emails triggered by actions such as enrollments, announcements, and automations.

## Engagement & Source Insights

You can also dive deeper into user behavior with:

- **Top Referrers:** Discover which sources or platforms are driving the most traffic to your school (for example, links from your website, social media, or email campaigns).
- **Top School Pages:** See which pages, courses, or resources are most popular with your visitors.

These insights help you understand student engagement and optimize your school’s content for better reach and experience.
