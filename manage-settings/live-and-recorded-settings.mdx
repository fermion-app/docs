### Available options

- **Enable HD recording**  
  Record live sessions in **high-definition quality**. Disabling this option will save bandwidth and storage but reduce video clarity.

  <Note>
  HD recordings consume more bandwidth and may increase processing time for large sessions.
  </Note>

- **Always stick to edge**  
  Prevent students from seeking backward during a live stream. When this option is disabled (default), viewers can freely rewind or jump forward in the live timeline.

  <Check>
  This feature is ideal for **real-time interactive classes** where you want everyone to stay synchronized with the instructor.
  </Check>

- **Generate AI transcripts automatically**  
  Automatically generate **[AI-powered transcripts](/live-classes/recording-and-captions)** once a livestream ends. This feature helps students review session content easily and improves accessibility.

  <Note>
  This is a **chargeable feature**. Refer to the [Fermion pricing](https://fermion.app/pricing) page for details.
  </Note>

  You can also enable this setting on a **per-stream basis** inside [Courses](/setting-up-course/prerequisites) → **Live Events** → **Edit Session**.

- **Automatically add everyone on stage**  
  Start live calls with all participants already on [stage](/live-classes/invite-to-stage). By default, live sessions begin in a webinar-style mode where attendees must be invited to turn on their mic or camera.

  <Check>
  Use this setting for **interactive classrooms or group discussions** where everyone should have speaking privileges from the start.

### Available options

- **Generate AI transcripts automatically**  
  Automatically create [transcripts and captions](/recorded-videos/captions) for recorded videos. 

  <Note>
  This is a **chargeable feature**. Learn more at [Fermion pricing](https://fermion.app/pricing).
  </Note>

- **Whitelisted playback origin**  
  Restrict video embedding and playback to specific authorized domains (e.g., `https://example.com`). This prevents unauthorized sharing or embedding of your videos on other websites.

  <Example>
  If your school website is hosted at `https://myschool.fermion.app`, you can add that domain to ensure playback only works there.
  </Example>

## Best Practices

- Enable **AI transcription** for accessibility and quick post-class content review.  
- Use **“Always stick to edge”** for synchronous teaching formats (e.g., live lectures, webinars).  
- Limit **whitelisted playback origins** to prevent content piracy.  
- For courses with multiple instructors, use **“Automatically add everyone on stage”** to reduce session setup time.
