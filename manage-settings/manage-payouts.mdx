Getting paid with Fermion is simple and hassle-free. Once your bank account is added in Payout Details, you can request a payout directly from your dashboard.

We like to think of payouts in two words: **easy and flexible**. You get paid how you want, when you want. 

Fermion allows you to get payout whenever you need, so you can focus on teaching and creating content rather than worrying about payments.  

Here’s how you can request a payout:

1. Go to **Billing & Earnings** in your instructor dashboard sidebar

2. Click on **Payout Details** and make sure your **bank account details** are added. Without this, your payout request cannot be processed.

2. Go to **Billings & Earnings** → **Billing** 
3. Click on **Request Bank Account Withdrawal**

Payouts are generally processed within **24 hours from Fermion’s end**, although your bank may take an additional 3–4 business days for the funds to appear in your account.  

<Tip>
You can track past payouts with the help of the **Transaction Ledger** in the same section.

If you ever face any issues or have questions, you can reach out to your Fermion relationship manager or email **support@codedamn.com**. Fermion takes care of the payments so you can focus on what you do best.
