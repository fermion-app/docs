When adding a new link, you’ll need to provide two details:

- **Link Label** – The text that will appear in the sidebar.  
- **Link URL** – The destination the link points to.

## Example

- **Link Label:** Schedule a 1:1 Call  
- **Link URL:** `https://cal.com/sahil-fermion/30min`  

This will create a new sidebar link called **Schedule a 1:1 call** that opens your cal.com calendar so students can book 1:1 calls.

## Notes

- You can add multiple links for different tools or resources.  
- Links are visible to users based on your organization’s user dashboard settings. You can remove them whenever needed
