Custom sidebar links allow instructors to personalize the **User Dashboard sidebar** by adding links to any resources, tools, 
or documentation that students frequently need. This feature makes navigation faster and more intuitive, 
giving students direct access to important materials without having to hunt through emails or separate platforms. 


You can use Custom Links for anything from scheduling third party events, linking to guides or assignments, integrating external tools, or providing quick access to your team’s resources - all right from the user dashboard.

## Example

- **Link Label:** Schedule a 1:1 Call  
- **Link URL:** `https://cal.com/sahil-fermion/30min`  

This will create a new sidebar link called **Schedule a 1:1 call** that opens your cal.com calendar so students can book 1:1 calls.
