Custom Links allow instructors to personalize the **User Dashboard sidebar** by adding links to any resources, tools, 
or documentation that students frequently need. This feature makes navigation faster and more intuitive, 
giving students direct access to important materials without having to hunt through emails or separate platforms. 


You can use Custom Links for anything from scheduling 1:1 calls, linking to guides or assignments, integrating external tools, or providing quick access to your team’s resources - all right from the user dashboard.

## How to Add a Custom Sidebar Link

Follow these steps:

1. Go to **Settings** → **User Dashboard** in your sidebar  
2. Select **Sidebar Custom Links**  
3. Click **Add another link** 
4. Enter the Link Label and Link URL 
5. Click on **Save Changes** to publish the custom links
6. Preview the new user dashboard by clicking the **Open user dashboard** button.

When adding a new link, you’ll need to provide two details:

- **Link Label** – The text that will appear in the sidebar.  
- **Link URL** – The destination the link points to.

## Example

- **Link Label:** Schedule a 1:1 Call  
- **Link URL:** `https://cal.com/sahil-fermion/30min`  

This will create a new sidebar link called **Schedule a 1:1 call** that opens your cal.com calendar so students can book 1:1 calls.
