The **User Access Log** feature allows instructors to monitor all active and past sessions in their school. You can see when users have logged in, their device details, IP addresses, and other session-specific information. Monitoring user sessions helps ensure account security, detect unauthorized access, and maintain oversight of student activity.

## Why user access logs are important

User access logs provide instructors with complete visibility into all user sessions, including login times, IP addresses, and device details. This not only helps identify suspicious activity and troubleshoot login issues but also ensures that the real user is accessing the platform, preventing account sharing or impersonation. This contributes to maintaining a secure and trustworthy learning environment for all students.

<Note>
If you have enabled a **[maximum device login limit](/manage-settings/change-school-settings#security)** of more than two, users will be able to login with the help of multiple devices and all of those sessions will be logged in this section.
