You can manually enroll users into your school without requiring them to sign up themselves. It ensures that everyone gets timely access to their [courses](/setting-up-course/prerequisites), and it eliminates the need for users to go through the sign-up process manually. You can also pre-assign users to specific groups, auto-enroll them into [bundles](/setting-up-course/bundle), and send welcome [emails](/marketing-tools/email-marketing) automatically to streamline the onboarding experience.

### Why importing users matters

Importing users helps you maintain a **smooth, organized onboarding experience**. It allows you to:
- Enroll learners before a program or course begins.  
- Give select users access to private or internal content.  
- Centralize data when migrating from another LMS or platform.  
- Ensure a consistent experience by pre-configuring access, groups, and emails.  

By setting up users manually or via CSV, you ensure that everyone is properly enrolled and ready to learn from day one, without confusion or missing credentials. It’s a small administrative step that can greatly improve efficiency and the overall user experience.

## How to manually enroll users

You can enroll users into your school with the help of the following steps:

<Steps>

<Step title="Go to the Import Users page">

This is where you can add new users manually or import them in bulk using a CSV file.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose your import method">
You can import users in two ways:
- **Single user import**: add one user manually.  
- **CSV import**: upload a file containing multiple user records.

</Step>

<Step title="Single User Import">
When adding a single user, fill out the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Name** | User’s full name (e.g. John Doe) |
| **Email** | User’s email address (required) |
| **Phone Number** | Optional, used for communication or verification |
| **Password** | Optional, leave blank to auto-generate one |
| **User Creation Timestamp** | Optional, set a custom creation date |

You can also configure additional options:
- **Welcome Email**: Send users their credentials and access details automatically.  
- **Auto-enroll in Products**: Grant users access to selected courses or products upon import. Select the products after toggling this option to add the user into the respective product 
- **Add to Groups**: Assign users to existing user groups or create a new one directly from this page.

Once done, click **Add Single User** to complete the enrollment.

</Step>

<Step title="CSV Import">
For adding multiple users at once, use the **CSV Import** option.

**CSV Import Instructions:**
Upload a CSV file containing columns for user data.  
After uploading, you’ll be able to **map your CSV columns** to the required fields.

**Available columns:**
- `Email`: User’s email address (**required**)  
- `Name`: User’s full name (optional)  
- `Password`: User’s password (optional; will be auto-generated if blank)  
- `Phone Number`:User’s phone number (optional)  
- `Created At`: User creation timestamp (optional)

Once uploaded and mapped, review the data and click **Import Users** to complete the process.

</Step>

And there you go, your users are now a part of your Fermion school and can be enrolled into products.
