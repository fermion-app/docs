Within the user's profile view, you'll see tabs for **Enrollments**, **Activity**, and **Exports**.

- The **Enrollments** tab shows all courses, bundles, events, or products that the user currently has access to.


To manually enroll a user in a product (such as a course, bundle, or digital product), simply select `Enroll in more products`, then choose the desired items. This allows you to give access even for users who joined via custom payments or special cases.
