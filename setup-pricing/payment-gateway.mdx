Students can pay using popular methods like **UPI apps, credit/debit cards, and net banking**. With instant verification and real-time updates, Fermion handles all the complexity of payment routing, settlement, and reconciliation for you.

## Custom payment gateway integration

If you already have a Razorpay account and prefer payments to be credited **directly to your own Razorpay account**, you can connect it as a custom payment gateway.  

This gives you full control over your payment settings, reconciliation, and settlements, while Fermion continues to handle the student checkout flow and reporting.
<Info>
 If no custom payment gateway is enabled, Fermion’s managed gateway will be active, and payments will be added to your Fermion balance for withdrawal via payouts. If custom Razorpay integration is enabled, student payments go directly to your Razorpay account.
</Info>

You can enable custom Razorpay integration using the following steps:

### Accessing payment gateways

## Receiving payouts

Payouts are the transfers of your earned revenue from Fermion to your bank account. Whenever students purchase your courses or content, the collected payments are accumulated in your Fermion account balance.  

Receiving payouts ensures that you get your earnings securely and on time. It's important to keep your payout details accurate so that funds are transferred without delays or errors. Getting paid with Fermion is simple and hassle-free. Once your bank account is added in Payout Details, you can request a payout directly from your dashboard.
