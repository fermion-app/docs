Fermion offers the following payment gateways out of the box:

-   Razorpay (Payments in INR)
-   Bank UPI (Payments in INR)
-   Stripe (All currencies supported)
-   PayPal (PayPal eligible currencies supported)

Fermion-managed gateways simplify payments for you if you want instant setup without managing external payment accounts. Payments made through these gateways are automatically added to your **Fermion withdrawable balance**, from where you can [request payouts](/manage-settings/manage-payouts) anytime.

Students can pay using popular methods like **UPI apps, credit/debit cards, net banking, PayPal, etc.**. With instant verification and real-time updates, Fermion handles all the complexity of payment routing, settlement, and reconciliation for you.

## Transactions Cost

Fermion deducts **0% commission** on all sales made through the platform. Unlike other platforms, **we do not take any cut** from your transactions. All charges that apply are **levied by the upstream payment providers** and not by Fermion. Here is a rough charge estimate from gateways we support. This might change in future if payment gateways change their charges.

#### Current Transaction Charges

| Payment Method  | Fee by Provider                                | Notes                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fermion UPI** | **0.5%** or **₹3 (whichever is higher)** + GST | Lowered rates via Fermion’s partnered bank       |
| **Razorpay**    | **2%** per transaction (+ GST)                 | Typical for cards, wallets, and UPI via Razorpay |
| **Stripe**      | 1-5% depending on currency                     | Stripe fee is applied directly                   |
| **PayPal**      | 4-8% depending on currency                     | PayPal fee is applied directly                   |
