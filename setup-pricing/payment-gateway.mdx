## Fermion-managed gateways

Fermion-managed gateways simplify payments for instructors who want instant setup without managing external payment accounts. Payments made through these gateways are automatically added to your **Fermion withdrawable balance**, from where you can request [payouts](/manage-settings/manage-payouts) anytime.

Students can pay using popular methods like **UPI apps, credit/debit cards, and net banking**. With instant verification and real-time updates, Fermion handles all the complexity of payment routing, settlement, and reconciliation for you.

<Note>
When utilizing Fermion managed gateways, schools can accept international payments with the help of Stripe and Paypal directly managed by Fermion.

### Fermion-managed Razorpay

Fermion’s managed Razorpay integration lets you accept payments through a secure, hosted Razorpay checkout without any setup or API configuration. Learners can pay using **credit/debit cards, net banking, wallets, UPI, or PayLater**, all powered by Razorpay’s robust payment infrastructure. The familiar and trusted Razorpay interface ensures a smooth and reliable payment experience, while Fermion automatically manages settlements, and [payouts](/manage-settings/manage-payouts) to your account balance.

This option gives you access to Razorpay’s complete checkout capabilities: including real-time validation, multi-method payments, and one-click retry flows, without requiring you to create or manage your own Razorpay account.

## Transactions Cost 

Fermion maintains **0% commission** on all sales made through the platform. Unlike other platforms, **we do not take any cut** from your transactions. All charges that apply are **levied by the upstream payment providers** and not by Fermion.

For smaller transactions (below ₹100–₹200), Razorpay may offer slightly lower transaction costs, while FermionUPI typically becomes more cost-effective for higher-value sales due to its reduced 0.5% charge structure.

#### Current Transaction Charges

| Payment Method | Provider / Source |  Fee by Provider | Notes |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| **FermionUPI** | Partner Bank | **0.5%** or **₹3 (whichever is higher)** + GST | Lowered rates via Fermion’s partnered bank |
| **Fermion-managed Razorpay** | Razorpay | **2%** per transaction (+ GST) | Typical for cards, wallets, and UPI via Razorpay |
| **Custom Gateway** | Razorpay | As per your provider’s plan | You can integrate your own credentials directly |

<Check> 
Fermion does **not** earn any commission from these fees. All charges are set and collected by banks or gateways directly.
</Check>

## Custom payment gateway integration

If you already have a Razorpay account and prefer payments to be credited **directly to your own Razorpay account**, you can connect it as a custom payment gateway.  

This gives you full control over your payment settings, reconciliation, and settlements, while Fermion continues to handle the student checkout flow and reporting.
<Info>
 If no custom payment gateway is enabled, Fermion’s managed gateway will be active, and payments will be added to your Fermion balance for withdrawal via payouts. If custom Razorpay integration is enabled, student payments go directly to your Razorpay account.
</Info>

You can enable custom Razorpay integration using the following steps:

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Credentials">
    Enter your **Key ID** and **Key Secret** provided by Razorpay. These credentials ensure that payments are securely linked to your account. [Learn more](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys/) on where to find these credentials.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Webhook">

## Receiving payouts

Payouts are the transfers of your earned revenue from Fermion to your bank account. Whenever students purchase your courses or content, the collected payments are accumulated in your Fermion account balance.  

Receiving payouts ensures that you get your earnings securely and on time. It's important to keep your payout details accurate so that funds are transferred without delays or errors. Getting paid with Fermion is simple and hassle-free. Once your bank account is added in Payout Details, you can request a payout directly from your dashboard.
