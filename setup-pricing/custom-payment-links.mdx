Fermion allows instructors to generate custom payment links for special cases where you want to offer a one-time sale or provide a unique discount to a specific user. This is useful for personalized offers, negotiation-based deal closures, or handling payments outside of your standard course/catalog setup.

> **Note:** The custom payment links feature must be enabled first for your school.
> To learn how to activate it, see [Manage Features](../manage-settings/manage-features).

  </Step>

    ![setup-pricing](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/10-10-2025/Arc_6Wq01U0Olx.rujqdx.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish plan">
    Once you have added a pricing plan, make sure that the plan is in a `Published` state
    ![publish](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/10-10-2025/Arc_9ANCMoCujV.asnbkc.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share the payment link">
    After you are done setting up this custom payment option, go back to the `Link customization` page of this product and copy the custom payment link that can be shared with the users.
    ![share link](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/10-10-2025/Arc_rqIvpv6Ahk.ojzlhx.png)
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once the user completes the payment via the link, **they are not automatically enrolled in your product or course**.You will need to manually enroll the user.

## When should you use custom payment links?

- Providing a bespoke discount to a user by request
- Arranging payment for a bundle or product not directly listed on your site
- Solving for any manual or special arrangement outside your usual checkout flow

> Need to enroll the user? Follow the steps in [Managing Instructors and Students](../manage-settings/manage-instructors) for how to add someone to a product after they have paid.
