---

If you already have a Razorpay or PhonePe account and prefer payments to be credited **directly to your own payment gateway account**, you can connect it as a custom payment gateway.

This gives you full control over your payment settings, reconciliation, and settlements, while Fermion continues to handle the student checkout flow and reporting.

<Info>
	If no custom payment gateway is enabled, Fermion's managed gateway will be active, and payments
	will be added to your Fermion balance for withdrawal via payouts. If custom payment gateway
	integration is enabled, student payments go directly to your payment gateway account.
</Info>

Fermion supports the following custom payment gateways:
