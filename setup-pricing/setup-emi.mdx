Fermion lets you add and manage multiple pricing plans for your digital products. You can setup a fixed pricing plan, which requires a one-time payment from the students, or you can setup a partial payment plan for your students which works like a custom-EMI plan.

In this documentation we will learn how you can setup a partial payment pricing plan for your courses or products.

<Warning>

    You can use the same flow to setup pricing for other products ([course bundles](/setting-up-course/bundle),
    [ebooks](/digital-products/introduction) etc). For simplicity, this documentation covers the setup flow for a course.

## What is a partial payment pricing plan?

Partial payment pricing plan is a type of pricing plan on Fermion where your students can pay you in installments instead of paying the entire amount in a single go.

After speaking with a lot of educators, we've realised that most of the students may not be able to afford course or product pricing, thus, you can setup a partial payment plan where you encourage your students to pay in installments.

You can also consider this as a custom-EMI plan since your students can pay you in installments. You can configure the EMI collection interval, minimum amount to pay, total cost and EMI options.

## Understanding terminologies

Before we figure out how to setup this pricing plan, there are a few things to understand. Let's go over them one by one:

-   **Total cost of product:**

    This is the total price of your product or the final price the user will pay
    overall. All the EMIs you will be setting up should result as a sum equal to
    this number.

-   **Minimum mandatory amount:**

    This is the mandatory amount that the user must pay upfront. User can pay
    more than this amount as well. Paying this amount will give user the access
    to product.

-   **EMI collection interval:**

    You can set the interval in days, ie, when want the user to pay the next EMI
    if available.

## How does a partial payment plan work?

We've developed the core infrastructure to setup a custom-EMI based plan on products, at Fermion.

A partial payment plan or a custom EMI plan encourages students to pay the product fees in intervals.

<Warning>

    You can configure the entire installment plan as an instructor, including
    setting up the minimum amount to pay, the collection interval and the total EMIs
    required.

</Warning>

Let's understand this with an example. This is how a **4 installment plan** will work:

<u>

    Assume that the user pays the minimum mandatory amount: $5 on November 19th,
    2024. Then, their (4 installment) EMI plan becomes:{' '}

</u>

-   Base payment of $5 done on November 19th, 2024
-   Installment #1 of $1.25 to be paid on or before December 19th, 2024
-   Installment #2 of $1.25 to be paid on or before January 18th, 2025
-   Installment #3 of $1.25 to be paid on or before February 17th, 2025
-   Installment #4 of $1.25 to be paid on or before March 19th, 2025

## Direct checkout links for partial payment plans

Fermion also allows you to share your partial payment plans directly with students through **direct checkout links**. This is especially useful if you want to integrate your checkout with an external website, email campaign, or social media promotion. By using direct checkout links, students can access the payment page for a specific plan immediately, without navigating through your course landing page.

For a complete guide on setting up and using direct checkout links, please refer to our [Direct Checkout Links](/custom-landing-pages/checkout-page-direct-links).

<Info>

    All the available installment plans are shown to your students and they can
    select one which fits best for them.
