Fermion lets you add and manage multiple pricing plans for your digital products. You can setup a fixed pricing plan, which requires a one-time payment from the students, or you can setup a partial payment plan for your students which works like a custom-EMI plan.

In this documentation we will learn how you can setup a fixed pricing plan for your courses or products.

<Warning>

    You can use the same flow to setup pricing for other products ([course bundles](/setting-up-course/bundle),
    [ebooks](/digital-products/introduction) etc). For simplicity, this documentation covers the setup flow for a course.

</Warning>

## How to setup a fixed pricing plan?

Head to any digital product in your school and click on the 'Pricing' button from the sidebar. Let's use a 'Course' for example.

### Step 2: Select the product
Now, select the course you'd like to set a pricing plan for.

-   Draft state means that your plan would not be visible to users. You can use this state to edit and setup your plan.

-   Unlisted state means that the plan would be functional but not visible on landing pages. You can use it to open checkout through API endpoint.

-   Published state means the plan would be functional and visible to users. Users will be able to purchase access to your product with this plan.
