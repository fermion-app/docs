Fermion lets you add and manage multiple pricing plans for your digital products. You can setup a fixed pricing plan, which requires a one-time payment from the students, or you can setup a partial payment plan for your students which works like a custom-EMI plan.

In this documentation we will learn how you can setup a fixed pricing plan for your courses or products.

<Warning>

    üìù You can use the same flow to setup pricing for other products (course bundles,
    ebooks etc). For simplicity, this documentation covers the setup flow for a course.

## How to setup a fixed pricing plan?

### Step 4: Click on `fixed plan`

Click on the `fixed plan` option on the screen and it will expand showcasing you multiple options. Make sure that the plan is in `draft` state unless and until you want to publish it.

-   Draft state means that your plan would not be visible to users. You can use this state to edit and setup your plan.

-   Unlisted state means that the plan would be functional but not visible on landing pages. You can use it to open checkout through API endpoint.

-   Published state means the plan would be functional and visible to users. Users will be able to purchase access to your product with this plan.

### Step 5: Add currencies to your pricing plan

Click on `Select a currency` option to add a currency and set the amount on the left input field. Click on `Add currency` to add the currency and the amount.

![Step 5](https://codedamn-website-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/19-11-2024/08%402x.pywrjh.png)

Finally click on `Save changes` to save the currency you just added. In case you need to delete it, click on `delete pricing plan`.

### Step 6: Support more currencies in your pricing plan

Fermion lets you sell your products in 180+ countries. You can add as many currencies as you need.

Click on "Add another currency" and repeat the same step as above.

<Warning>

    üí° You can setup "default prices". For example checking on this option will make
    it the "default price" and all the unsupported countries will fall back to this
    price. ![step8](https://codedamn-website-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/19-11-2024/28%402x.ucxqtk.png)
