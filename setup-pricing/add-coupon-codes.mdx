Coupon codes are a great way to promote your courses at a discounted price and get more students to enroll in your course. Fermion lets you create and manage coupon codes within your course flow, which you can easily share with your students.

You can either create a fixed amount coupon (for eg: ₹500 off) or you can create a discount percentage. In this documentation we'll talk about both the ways of creating a coupon code.

## Global Coupon Codes

Global coupon codes allow you to create school-level discounts that apply across all your products: including [courses](/setting-up-course/prerequisites), [bundles](/setting-up-course/bundle), and other digital offerings. Instead of creating separate coupons for each item, a global coupon code ensures that students can use a single code anywhere within your school.

To add a global coupon, simply create a new coupon and enable the **Mark the coupon as school coupon** toggle. Once the changes are saved, this setting makes your coupon a global coupon code, allowing it to be applied universally across your entire catalog of products. Learn how to create a coupon code in the next section.

You can choose to either select a "Fixed Amount Discount" or a "Percentage Discount"

-   **Fixed amount discount** is where you are giving a flat discount with your coupon code. For eg: on a course of ₹5000, you can add a fixed amount discount of ₹500, which makes the overall payable amount for user to be ₹4500 (excluding taxes). It is best to use to retain magic numbers on your pricing, and making the overall calculations easier for both the parties.

-   **Percentage discount** is where you can create a coupon code discounting a percentage number. For eg: you can create a 10% OFF coupon on your course priced at ₹100 which makes the overall payable amount for the user to be ₹90 (excluding taxes).
