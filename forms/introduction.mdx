<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Enable Forms Feature">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2: Navigate to Forms Page">
    Click on the 'Forms' page from your instructor dashboard's sidebar, then click on 'Create new form' button.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3: Form Editor Panes">
    Now, you will see the form editor page, consisting of 3 'Panes':
    - Blocks pane
    - Preview pane
    - Content pane

    ![forms-panes](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/29-09-2025/seelen-ui_RddA2GAD44.atnzef.png)

    The Blocks pane on the left lists steps, the center shows a live preview, and the Content pane on the right lets you configure the selected block.

    Note: By default, all new forms are pre-loaded with `Welcome` and `Thank you` blocks.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4: Add a New Block">
    To add a new block, click on `Add blocks` button from the bottom of the blocks pane.
  </Step>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 6: Add the Block to Form">
    Select a block from here and click on `Add this block to form`. We offer the following blocks that are further customizable:
    - **Short text**: Capture brief responses such as names or titles.

    - **Star Rating**: Allows user to rate on a scale of 1-5 stars 
    - **Opinion Scale** Lets users rate on a custom scale with labels.

    For example, let's select `Short text` block.
    ![add-a-block-form](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/29-09-2025/seelen-ui_QMl2nRVcR0.utayex.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 7: Customize the Block">
    Once a block is added to the form, you can further configure it from the 'Content Pane' on the right side. This pane has multiple customization options like:
    - Edit your question
    - Edit your placeholder
    - Edit the text on the `Next` button
    - Add a description(with simple text formatting and the ability to include hyperlinks and YouTube videos)
    - Make a question mandatory
    - Add a cover image

    Additionally, depending on the block you select, the content panes' customization options will change. For example, the long text block has an option to customize character limit, the address block lets you customize the the street, city, stat, ZIP code and country fields' visibility and the rating block lets you customize the number of stars.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 8: Arrange and Publish Form">
    Once you have added and customized all the blocks, you can further customize the 'flow' of the form by re-arranding the blocks. You can do this by clicking on the 'drag' handle on the blocks.
    ![drag-blocks-forms](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/23-10-2025/chrome_7QLpNABnGw.atawoh.png)

    Once you are done customizing your form, click on `Save` and then click on `Publish`. You can also preview the form by clicking on the `play` button.
    ![publish-forms](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/23-10-2025/chrome_22KmzDWLfd.oyhtya.png)
