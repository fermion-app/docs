Fermion helps you build multiâ€‘step forms to capture detailed information and feedback. You can also share a public link outside of your organization. Additinally, you can customize fields, require answers, add descriptions and cover images, then publish when ready.

<Tip>You can also create onboarding forms attached to your school so that you can gather introductory data from new users. Learn more about [user onboarding forms](/forms/onboarding-form) </Tip>

## Getting Started
- Step 1: Make sure that the forms feature is enabled for your school.

- Step 3: Now, you will see the form editor page, consisting of 3 'Panes':
    - Blocks pane
    - Preview pane
    - Content pane

    The Blocks pane on the left lists steps, the center shows a live preview, and the Content pane on the right lets you configure the selected block.

Note: By default, all new forms are pre-loaded with `Welcome` and `Thank you` blocks.

- Step 6: Select a block from here and click on `Add this block to form`. We offer the following blocks that are further customizable:
    - Short text - for capturing simple details like names.
    - Long text - to capture answers in paragraphs.
    - Phone number
    - Website
    - Date
    - Address
    - Dropdown, Single and Multi select questions
    - Contact information - for capturing detailed user information like full name, email and mobile number.
    - Rating

    For example, let's select `Short text` block.

- Step 7: Once a block is added to the form, you can further configure it from the 'Content Pane' on the right side. This pane has multiple customization options like:
    - Edit your question
    - Edit your placeholder
    - Edit the text on the `Next` button
    - Add a description(with simple text formatting and the ability to include hyperlinks and YouTube videos)
    - Make a question mandatory
    - Add a cover image

    Additionally, depending on the block you select, the content panes' customization options will change. For example, the long text block has an option to customize character limit, the address block lets you customize the the street, city, stat, ZIP code and country fields' visibility and the rating block lets you customize the number of stars.

- Step 8: Once you have added and customized all the blocks, you can further customize the 'flow' of the form by re-arranding the blocks. You can do this by clicking on the 'drag' handle on the blocks.
