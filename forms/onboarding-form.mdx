The **Onboarding Form** allows you to collect essential details from every new user who signs up for your school. When a new user creates an account, they’ll be prompted to fill out this form before accessing the platform. It’s a great way to gather important information like graduation level, interests, or consent details, ensuring a smoother onboarding experience.

## Why use an onboarding form?

Onboarding forms help you collect essential information from new users automatically during sign-up. This information can include personal details, preferences, or any other data necessary to provide a tailored experience. By gathering responses upfront, you can personalize learning paths, verify eligibility, segment users into relevant groups, and ensure all necessary compliance or consent requirements are met.

Additionally, onboarding forms streamline administrative processes by reducing manual data entry and giving instructors a clear overview of each new user’s profile. The data collected can also help you make informed decisions and enhance the overall learning experience for students.
