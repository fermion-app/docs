After creating and sharing a form, you can access all the responses submitted by users.  
Fermion allows you to view submissions in both **Individual View** and **Table View**, and export the data in **CSV format** for offline analysis.

You can access your form submissions directly inside your form editor with the help of the following steps:

</Step>

<Step title="View individual submission">
- In the submissions panel, you can view all the responses respectively in a block view.  
- This is useful for reviewing single responses or following up with specific users.

</Step>

<Step title="Export submissions">
- In the submissions panel, click the **Export CSV** button.  
- This will download all form responses in a spreadsheet-friendly format.  
- This file can be used for offline analysis, reporting, or importing into other tools.

<Tip>
Table view is best for quick analysis of multiple responses, while individual view is perfect for detailed inspection of a single submission. Always export CSV if you want to create backups or do further processing.
