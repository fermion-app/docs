The following details are also mentioned on the left pane of the contest.

**Key Instructions:**

- This is a timed test. Ensure you are not interrupted during the contest, as the timer cannot be paused once started.  
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection and a modern web browser.  
- The attempt will be proctored and recorded. Avoid switching to other windows or moving your cursor out of the test window during the attempt.  

These are predefined instructions set by Fermion. You can edit your own custom instructions by heading over to the contest landing page. Learn more about [custom instructions](/contests/set-up-contest#steps-to-set-up-a-contest).

Users can click **Continue** once they are ready to proceed.
