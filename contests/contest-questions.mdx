## Adding questions to your contest

When building your contest, you can add different types of questions to assess participants in various ways. Fermion supports the following question types:

- **Interactive Coding Lab:** Real-time coding problems where participants write, run, and submit code in an interactive editor. Useful for practical programming assessments.
- **DSA Coding Lab:** Specialized coding questions focused on Data Structures and Algorithms. These problems are auto-graded and can include custom test cases.
- **Quizzes:** Multiple-choice or short-answer questions to test theoretical knowledge or concepts.

You can mix and match these question types within a single contest to create a comprehensive assessment.

## Sectional timer for contests

You can set individual time limits for each section of your contest using sectional timers. This helps structure your contest more effectively and ensures participants manage their time within each section.

### How to set sectional timers

<Steps>

<Step title="Click on the timer icon next to the section name">
  Click on the timer icon beside the section name to set the sectional timer.<br/>
  ![Timer Icon](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/02-01-2026/Arc_iHvwzcDhvc.eijysm.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Enter the maximum number of minutes for the section">
  A dialog will appear where you can specify the max minutes allotted to this section. Enter the desired value.<br/>
  ![Enter Section Minutes](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/02-01-2026/Arc_XSVkFVLNcl.lenxwa.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Timer appears below the section name">
  Once set, the time limit will be shown beneath the section name and in the sidebar timer. This helps participants track their remaining time for each section.<br/>
  ![Sectional Timer Shown](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/02-01-2026/Arc_NJ7t1s7n7F.cwwrqe.png)

  When the contest begins, users see the time remaining for each section in the sidebar, making it easy to manage their time.

</Step>

</Steps>



<Info>
**Note:** The total time across all sections must **not** exceed the total contest duration. The platform will prompt you if you exceed the overall contest time limit.
