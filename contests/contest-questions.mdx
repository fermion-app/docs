## Adding Questions to Your Contest

When building your contest, you can add different types of questions to assess participants in various ways. Fermion supports the following question types:

- **Interactive Coding Lab:** Real-time coding problems where participants write, run, and submit code in an interactive editor. Useful for practical programming assessments.
- **DSA Coding Lab:** Specialized coding questions focused on Data Structures and Algorithms. These problems are auto-graded and can include custom test cases.
- **Quizzes:** Multiple-choice or short-answer questions to test theoretical knowledge or concepts.

You can mix and match these question types within a single contest to create a comprehensive assessment.
