## What is a Contest?

A **Contest** on Fermion is a competitive assessment or challenge that allows you to evaluate student skills in a timed, proctored environment. Contests can include coding problems, quizzes, or other types of assessments, and are designed to foster engagement, learning, and healthy competition among participants.

On Fermion, you can create and manage contests directly from your instructor dashboard. Contests can be used as standalone events, integrated into courses, or included in bundles to enhance your learning offerings.

Once you create a contest, Fermion handles participant registration, submission management, and real-time scoring. The [User attempts](/contests/introduction) page gives you a central place to track attempts, review submissions, and view analytics on participant performance.

<Info>Before you start, make sure **Contests** are enabled under **Manage Features** in your instructor dashboard. This allows you to create and run contests on Fermion. Learn how to enable features at Fermion [here](/manage-settings/manage-features)</Info>
