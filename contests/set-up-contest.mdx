Setting up your first contest on Fermion is straightforward. This guide will walk you through each step, from creating a new contest to configuring its settings and publishing it for participants. Fermion makes it easy to manage your contest, track attempts, and analyze results.

<Info>
Before you begin, ensure that **Contests** are enabled under **Manage Features** in your instructor dashboard. This is required to create and run contests on Fermion. Learn how to enable features [here](/manage-settings/manage-features).

## Creating a contest

Your contest page is where participants will view problems, submit solutions, and track their progress. A well-configured contest page helps ensure a smooth experience for both organizers and participants.

## Contest access, pricing, and coupons

Contests can be free or paid, and you can control access just like other digital products on Fermion.

You can set up a **[fixed pricing plan](/setup-pricing/fixed-pricing-plan)** for paid contests, or use a **[partial payment plan](/setup-pricing/setup-emi)** if you want to allow installment payments. You can also import pricing from other products.  For more information, see [Pricing FAQs](/setup-pricing/common-faqs).

## Contest settings & management

Manage your contest’s settings to control access and maintain organization.

**Enrollment Settings:**
Decide who can participate in your contest. By default, contests are open / visible to anyone that has access to your school.

You can change this by enabling `Manual enrollment`
![manual enroll](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/09-10-2025/Arc_qDKTwndvq3.kjwwuy.png)

<Tip>
If the contest is linked to a course or bundle, enrolled users will automatically get access. Learn more about [Linking Contests to Courses](/contests/introduction).
