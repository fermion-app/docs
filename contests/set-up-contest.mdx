## Creating a contest

Your contest page is where participants will view problems, submit solutions, and track their progress. A well-configured contest page helps ensure a smooth experience for both organizers and participants.

## Contest Access, Pricing, and Coupons

Contests can be free or paid, and you can control access just like other digital products on Fermion.

You can set up a **[fixed pricing plan](/setup-pricing/fixed-pricing-plan)** for paid contests, or use a **[partial payment plan](/setup-pricing/setup-emi)** if you want to allow installment payments. For more information, see [Pricing FAQs](/setup-pricing/common-faqs).

You can also create and manage **coupon codes** for contests, allowing discounts, setting expiration dates, and controlling usage limits. Learn more in the [Coupon Codes](/setup-pricing/add-coupon-codes) documentation.

## Contest settings & management

Manage your contest’s settings to control access and maintain organization.

**Enrollment Settings:**
Decide who can participate in your contest. By default, contests are open / visible to anyone that has access to your school.

You can change this by enabling `Manual enrollment`
