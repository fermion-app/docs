## Introduction

Downloadable products are digital files that your users can purchase or access directly from Fermion. These can include templates, guides, reports, software, compressed files or any other type of file you want to distribute digitally.

## Create a downloadable product

Creating your first **downloadable product** on Fermion is as easy as it can get. This guide walks you through the entire process: from setting up a dedicated landing page to uploading your digital file in the Product Builder. With Fermion, you can showcase your content professionally, control access, and offer secure downloads to your audience.

<Info>
Before you start, make sure **Digital Products** are enabled under **Manage Features** in your instructor dashboard. This allows you to create and sell downloadable products on Fermion. Learn how to enable features [here](/onboarding/account-setup#step-2%3A-manage-features)

## Product pricing and coupon codes

Pricing for downloadable products works the same way as it does for all other digital content on Fermion.  

You can create a **[fixed pricing plan](/setup-pricing/fixed-pricing-plan)**, where buyers pay a one-time amount, or a **[partial payment plan](/setup-pricing/setup-emi)**, allowing payment in installments. For common queries regarding pricing plans, refer to [pricing FAQs](/setup-pricing/common-faqs).  

Similarly, **coupon codes** also work the same for digital products as they do for courses. You can create discount codes, set expiration dates, and control usage limits. Learn more in the [coupon codes](/setup-pricing/add-coupon-codes) documentation.

## Enrolling users

Students can purchase **downloadable products** directly from the landing page.
