## What is Object Storage?

Object storage on Fermion is a powerful file management system that allows you to upload, organize, and serve files for your [digital products](/digital-products/introduction), [courses](/setting-up-course/prerequisites), and other content. It provides a centralized location to store and manage all your files, from images and PDFs to videos and downloadable resources.

Fermion's object storage is designed with flexibility and security in mind, giving you complete control over how your files are accessed and distributed.

## Understanding File Visibility

Object storage on Fermion has **two distinct types** of file storage based on visibility and access control:

### Private Files

**Private files** are secure files that cannot have publicly shareable URLs and are only for internal use within your Fermion platform. These files are ideal for:

- Student-only resources that require enrollment
- Internal course materials and [attachments](/setting-up-course/attachments)
- Protected [eBook](/digital-products/introduction) files
- Sensitive documents that should only be accessible to enrolled users
- Private [assignment](/setting-up-course/assignments) materials


### Public Files

**Public files** can be accessed by anyone on the internet with a direct link to the file. These files are suitable for:

- Landing page images and thumbnails
- Marketing materials and promotional graphics
- [Course landing page](/setting-up-course/landing-page) covers and banners
- [eBook landing page](/digital-products/landing-page) preview images
- Social media assets
- Public documentation and guides
- [Blog](/custom-landing-pages/blogs) post images
- Public [form](/forms/introduction) assets

<Warning>
Be careful when uploading files to public storage. Once a file is made public, anyone with the URL can access it. Never upload sensitive information, student data, or proprietary content to public storage.
</Warning>
