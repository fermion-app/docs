## What is an eBook?

An **eBook** (electronic book) is a digital version of a printed book that can be read on computers or tablets. Unlike physical books, eBooks can be easily distributed and accessed instantly.  

On Fermion, eBooks are digital products that you can create, sell, and manage directly from your instructor dashboard. They can be linked to **[courses](/digital-products/ebook-course)**, **[embedded externally](/digital-products/embed-ebook)**, or sold as standalone resources to your audience. You can also add eBooks to [Bundles](/setting-up-course/bundle) at Fermion.
