## eBook Pricing and Coupon Codes

Pricing for eBooks works the same way as it does for all other digital products on Fermion. 

You can create a **[fixed pricing plan](/setup-pricing/fixed-pricing-plan)**, where buyers pay a one-time amount, or a **[partial payment pricing plan](/setup-pricing/setup-emi)**, allowing payment in installments. For common queries regarding pricing plans, you can refer [Pricing FAQs](/setup-pricing/common-faqs)

Similarly, **coupon codes** also work the same for eBooks as they do for courses and other digital products. You can create discount codes, set expiration dates, and control usage limits. To learn how to create and manage coupon codes for a product, refer to [Coupon Codes](/setup-pricing/add-coupon-codes) documentation.

## eBook Settings & Management

Manage your eBook’s settings and configurations to control access and maintain organization.  

**Enrollment Settings:**  
Decide how students can enroll in your eBook. You can restrict enrollment to only admins, by checking the **Only allow you (admin) to enroll students in this ebook** box, meaning no one can buy or access the eBook independently, even if it’s published and public. For more information about enrolling users for an eBook, refer to [Enroll Users](/ebooks/enroll-students) documentation. 
<Tip> If the eBook is part of a course, enrolled course users can still access it. Learn more about [Linking eBooks to course](/ebooks/ebook-course)</Tip>

**Management Actions:**  
Perform important actions to keep your eBook library organized:  
- **Archive eBook:** Temporarily remove the eBook from public view without deleting it.  
- **Delete eBook:** Permanently remove the eBook from your account. Please note that this action is **non reversible** in nature
