_Another mind-boggling reason why Fermion stands out among other traditional LMS platforms is its ability to integrate interactive coding labs at the click of a button!_

Coding labs on Fermion are highly powered linux environment which boot in under 3 seconds, and give learners almost a VSCode-like experience on web. These labs are highly interactive and evaluative in nature, let's look at a coding lab below:

This lab includes a powerful editor, terminal and browser preview.

Alongside, it also includes an `Instructions` and `Challenges` section so that students know exactly what they have to do when they land on your lab.

We make sure that when you are teaching a technical concept, students aren't simply just learning, but they're learning by doing. These labs force students to solve hands-on, what they've just learnt by you.

We believe in the philosophy of learning by doing, and we've brought the same concept to Fermion by letting technical you integrate hands-on interactive and evaluative coding labs in seconds.

With over 5000+ coding labs and quiz questions available, you can easily add interactive and evaluative elements to your courses.

This helps your courses stand out in the market by offering a practical learning experience that is crucial for aspiring developers.

Not just this, you can go beyond and even add hands-on coding projects as well as interview kits inside your courses.
