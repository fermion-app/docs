## Setting up affiliate marketing

Fermion offers you a built-in affiliate system without letting you spend a minute building anything. You can leverage this tooling to get started quickly and save time that you may have otherwise spent building a custom affiliate program.

Setting up affiliate marketing system on Fermion is a simple process:

<Steps>

<Step title="Enable affiliate marketing">

Affiliate System for your online school is `DISABLED` by default. Head over to the `Marketing` section in the `Manage Features` section from your Fermion dashboard, to enable affiliate marketing and setup your program. Learn more about [manage features](/manage-settings/manage-features) 

</Step>

<Step title="Access affiliate marketing">
Head over to **Marketing Tools â†’ Affiliate marketing** to access affiliate marketing tools and configuration.

</Step>

<Step title="Configure your affiliate marketing parameters">

The `Affiliate settings` is the area from where you can manage your affiliate marketing program data.

![step9](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/22-10-2025/chrome_3eepad0bwa.hfpifa.png)

You can switch the program status:

- Clicking on `disable program` will completely disable the program. This means that if you have any existing affiliate links, they will stop working.
- Clicking on `unlisted program` will partialy disable the program. You would not be able to create any new links but the existing affiliate links will keep working as expected.
- Clicking on `public program` means that your program is public for your users.

You can customise a default percentage commission from this area. This means that all the users by default will be eligible for this percentage commission.
</Step>
</Steps>
#### Enable unenrolled users to create published products link

When this toggle is enabled, users who are **not enrolled** in your published courses or products will still be able to create and share affiliate links for those items. This allows broader promotion of your courses and can help expand your affiliate network.  

#### Enable unenrolled users to create unlisted products link

This option allows users who **arenâ€™t enrolled** in your unlisted digital products to create affiliate links for those items. Enabling this can help you reach more potential affiliates, but keep in mind that it may expose your unlisted courses or products to a wider audience than intended.  

<Tip>
Consider using this toggle only for select campaigns where broader promotion is acceptable, as it may reveal unlisted content to more people.
</Tip>


Make sure to click on `Save changes` to save the settings you have configured.

Once you click on `Public program` and `Save changes` your affiliate program will be live for your users!

## How your affiliate system looks like for your users

Every user will be able to see an option - `Refer and earn money` inside their course dashboard once your affiliate program is public. This is how it will look like:

![stepxs](https://codedamn-website-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/13-11-2024/08%402x.pxzwmp.png)

Once they click here, they will be redirected to their `Affiliate dashboard`. This is how their affiliate dashboard will look like:

![stepyx](https://codedamn-website-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/13-11-2024/01%402x.fvuyzr.png)

- The user affiliate dashboard shows data for all the courses and sale which they are an affiliate partner of.
- Every product has an associated affiliate link which is unique to every user.
- Additionally, with every product and affiliate link, data such as: the comission %, amount earned, new sales, valid sales, and refunded sales are also visible (refer image below).
- The data is updated in real-time.

## Affiliate terms of service for users

Below are the terms of service we notify to every user who is a part of the affiliate program under your school on Fermion:

1. When a user shares their affiliate link with someone and they purchase, it will add as to "New sale" in your dashboard.

3. At any point, if the sale is refunded for some reason, it'll move to `Refunded sales` section.

4. Minimum balance to withdraw is â‚¹1000 if the user is based out of India, or $150 (or equivalent) if the user is based outside of India.

5. User's affiliate payout will only be done via bank transfer and no other means.

6. If a user is based outside of India, there would be additional SWIFT bank transfer charges applicable.

7. Payouts will be done at most once every month.

8. Affiliate commission will be rewarded for one-time sales for now.

9. In case any user needs more help, they can contact their website administrator (you).

## Additional affiliate tooling for your academy

#### Monitor your affiliate sales

There are various functionalities available for your school inside the Affiliate Program. Click on `Sales dashboard` inside the `Affiliate Marketing` tab.

The `Affiliate sales dashboard` is the area where you can view and monitor your recent affiliate sales. It shows the name of the affiliate user, the product name of the sale they helped you make, the commission they earned as well as the date of the sale.

![step2](https://codedamn-website-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/13-11-2024/58%402x.cljpkc.png)

#### Create custom affiliate links

Head over to `Create custom link` section, from the left sidebar.

![step3](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/22-10-2025/chrome_qh3VjusW0x.hpjjvb.png)

This is the area from where you can create and set up custom affiliate links for your users. For example: if you are partnering up with a student influencer who would also like to market your course to drive additional earnings for you as well as themselves, you can create a custom affiliate link with a lowered commission rate for that user (different from other users).

On the screen, you will see all the courses and digital products you have created inside your school. Click on any course, for which you would like to create a custom link for. For example: I have created a bunch of demo courses (shown in the below image) inside my school, and selected a course to create a custom link for.

![step4](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/22-10-2025/chrome_FoIFkqrlxr.mecbii.png)

Once you have selected your product, scroll to the bottom of the page where you can search a specific user by their email. Simply enter the email and click on `Search for users`, once you find the user, click on their name.

![step5](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/22-10-2025/chrome_V4CuVOw6ea.ycukxu.png)

Once you click on the user's name, enter the percentage commission rate for the user and click on `Create Affiliate Link`

You will see the below modal, once your link is successfully created. This link will be visible to you as well as the user inside their affiliate dashboards.

![step7](https://codedamn-website-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/13-11-2024/08%402x.wzbllo.png)

Voila! You just learnt how to create custom links for your platform! ðŸŽ‰

#### Monitor all custom links

Head over to `List all custom links` tab from the left sidebar. This is the area which lists down all the custom affiliate links you have created so you can view and monitor them at one glance.

![step8](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/22-10-2025/chrome_kGDusmBy2H.zsbewk.png)

## How affiliate payouts work

- Fermion manages and dispatches payouts to all affiliates who are a part of your school minimising your hassle to manually calculate and share payments.

- Minimum balance for the user to withdraw their payments is â‚¹1000 if they're based out of India, or $150 (or equivalent) if they're based outside of India.

- All affiliate payouts will be done via bank transfers.

- If affiliates are based outside of India, there would be additional SWIFT bank transfer charges applicable.

- All affiliates would be able to add their payment information to receive payouts, from inside their user affiliate dashboard.

- Fermion charges 1% fee on every affiliate sale to process the sale for you. For example: if your school is under the basic (free plan) and you have set a 10% commission for your affiliates, here's how the payout structure would look like for you:

  - Affiliate commission: 10%
  - Fermion commission : 10%
  - Fermion affiliate fee: 1%

- The invoices for affiliates will also be accounted for by Fermion.
