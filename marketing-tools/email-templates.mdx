Fermion allows you to customize and automate all system-generated emails to align with your brand and improve communication with your users. From setting up reminders for [live events](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes) to editing default templates for different user actions, you have full control over how and when your platform communicates with learners and instructors.

## Live event email reminders

<Note>
By default, all system-generated emails are sent from a **Fermion-associated email address**. If you want to use your **own domain** as the email sender, please refer to the [Email Sender Configuration](/marketing-tools/email-autoamtion) documentation to learn how to verify and connect your domain.
</Note>

You can keep your participants informed and minimize missed sessions by enabling automatic reminder emails for all [live events](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes) hosted on Fermion.
When enabled, the system automatically sends reminder emails to all registered participants **24 hours, 6 hours, and 30 minutes** before the event begins, ensuring they have timely access to session details and joining links.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open email sender">
    Navigate to your instructor dashboard → **Settings → Email sender**.
