## Sending live class reminders


Once your WhatsApp Business account is connected to Fermion, you can start sending automated reminders for your [live sessions](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes). Follow these steps to create and link a WhatsApp message template for your class reminders.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a WhatsApp message template">
    Go to the **Message Templates** section under **Marketing Tools → WhatsApp Marketing** and click **Create Template**.  

    In this section, you can design a new message template using dynamic variables such as session name, start time, and participant name.

    ![](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/22-10-2025/chrome_vFmeKYw4qC.ucjvev.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize your template">
    Preview the message on the right side to see how it will look to your students.  
    Make sure your tone is friendly and professional, and all dynamic variables are correctly inserted.

  <Info>
  Templates are usually reviewed and approved within **a few seconds**, but sometimes the process can take **up to 24 hours** depending on WhatsApp’s moderation queue.
  </Info>

    **Example Template:**

    - **Template Name:** `live_session_reminder`  
    - **Header (Optional):** *Live Session Starting Soon*  
    - **Body:**  
      ```
      Hi {{participantName}},

      Your live session "{{sessionName}}" starts at {{sessionStartTime}} 
      in {{timeUntilStart}}.

      Don't miss out on this exclusive learning opportunity! 
      Join us for an interactive session where you can ask questions 
      and engage with the instructor.
      ```
    - **Footer (Optional):** `Powered by Fermion`  
    - **Button Text (Optional):** `Join Live Session`


        ![](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/22-10-2025/chrome_P6bcJZTxRo.hzsuyw.png)
### Template Variables

When creating your WhatsApp message template, you can use dynamic variables to automatically personalize each reminder. These variables are replaced with real data for every student and session, making each message feel tailored and professional.

Below are the variables currently supported in Fermion WhatsApp templates:

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `{{participantName}}` | Automatically inserts the participant’s full name. |
| `{{schoolName}}` | Displays the name of your school |
| `{{sessionName}}` | Displays the name of the live session. |
| `{{sessionStartTime}}` | Shows the exact start time of the live session. |
| `{{timeUntilStart}}` | Displays how much time is left before the session starts (e.g., “30 minutes”). |

  <Warning>
  **Currently, only utility templates are supported.** These are templates for notifications or reminders. 
  
  If you try to create a **marketing or promotional** template (e.g., discounts, offers, etc.), **WhatsApp will reject it.** If you need help setting up marketing templates, please contact our team at (support@codedamn.com).
  </Warning>

    Once done, click **Save Template** to store it in your WhatsApp marketing template library. Your template will now be sent to WhatsApp for approval and would take some time to get approved by Meta. 
    
    Meta typically reviews and approves message templates within a few minutes to a few hours. In some cases, it may take up to 24 hours for approval.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toggle Live Session reminder and link a template">
    After saving the template and getting it approved by Meta, Toggle the **Live Session Reminders** button and link the created template to the reminder. At a particular moment, you can only link 1 template to the live session reminder. 
    ![](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/08-10-2025/44___pm__2_.ojxwis.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start sending reminders">
    Once linked, Fermion will automatically send WhatsApp reminders to all enrolled participants before the live session starts.
  </Step>
  </Steps>
   And that’s it! You’re all set to start sending WhatsApp reminders straight from Fermion. No more missed classes or last-minute confusion.
    
  ## Messaging limits

By default, Meta allows you to send up to **250 messages/day** from a single WhatsApp Business number. This ensures that your account remains in good standing and prevents spam or abuse.  

However, this daily limit can be increased as your business grows by verifying your business account with Facebook Business Manager and scaling your message tiers. Increasing your messaging limit allows you to reach more students or participants efficiently without interruptions.  

To learn more about how messaging limits work and how to request higher limits, refer to the official Meta documentation:  
[Learn more about WhatsApp messaging limits](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/)


  <Tip>
    In addition to getting verified on Facebook Business Manager, you can also increase your messaging limit by sending **high-quality messages** to at least **1,000 unique users over a rolling 7-day period**.  
  </Tip>
