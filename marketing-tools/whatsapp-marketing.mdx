## Sending live class reminders


Once your WhatsApp Business account is connected to Fermion, you can start sending automated reminders for your live sessions. Follow these steps to create and link a WhatsApp message template for your class reminders.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a WhatsApp message template">
    Go to the **Message Templates** section under **Marketing Tools → WhatsApp Marketing** and click **Create Template**.  

    In this section, you can design a new message template using dynamic variables such as session name, start time, and participant name.

    ![](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/08-10-2025/00___pm__2_.pdlfob.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize your template">
    Preview the message on the right side to see how it will look to your students.  
    Make sure your tone is friendly and professional, and all dynamic variables are correctly inserted.

    **Example Template:**

    - **Template Name:** `live_session_reminder`  
    - **Header:** *Live Session Starting Soon*  
    - **Body:**  
      ```
      Hi {{participant_name}},

      Your live session "{{session_name}}" starts at {{session_start_time}} 
      in {{time_until_start}}.

      Don't miss out on this exclusive learning opportunity! 
      Join us for an interactive session where you can ask questions 
      and engage with the instructor.
      ```
    - **Footer (Optional):** `Powered by Fermion`  
    - **Button Text (Optional):** `Join Live Session`


        ![](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/08-10-2025/28___pm__2_.avkysh.png)
### Template Variables

When creating your WhatsApp message template, you can use dynamic variables to automatically personalize each reminder. These variables are replaced with real data for every student and session, making each message feel tailored and professional.

Below are the variables currently supported in Fermion WhatsApp templates:

| Variable | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `{{participant_name}}` | Automatically inserts the participant’s full name. |
| `{{session_name}}` | Displays the name of the live session. |
| `{{session_start_time}}` | Shows the exact start time of the live session. |
| `{{time_until_start}}` | Displays how much time is left before the session starts (e.g., “in 30 minutes”). |


    Once done, click **Save Template** to store it in your WhatsApp marketing template library. Your template will now be sent to WhatsApp for approval and would take some time to get approved by Meta.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toggle Live Session reminder and link a template">
    After saving the template, Toggle the **Live Session Reminders** button and link the created template to the reminder. At a particular moment, you can only link 1 template to the live session reminder. 
    ![](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/08-10-2025/44___pm__2_.ojxwis.png)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start sending reminders">
    Once linked, Fermion will automatically send WhatsApp reminders to all enrolled participants before the live session starts.

    By default, Meta allows you to send up to **250 messages per day**.  
    However, this limit can be increased by verifying your business and scaling your message tiers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Learn how to increase message limits">
    To learn how to increase your WhatsApp message limit, refer to the official Meta documentation:  
    [Learn more about WhatsApp messaging limits](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/messaging-limits/)
  </Step>
</Steps>

And that’s it! You’re all set to start sending WhatsApp reminders straight from Fermion. No more missed classes or last-minute confusion.
