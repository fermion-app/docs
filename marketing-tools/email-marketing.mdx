## What is Email Marketing?

Email marketing is a powerful tool for engaging your learners directly through their inbox. It allows you to send targeted messages, announcements, promotions, and updates in a personal and measurable way. At Fermion, email marketing can be especially useful for promoting new [courses](/setting-up-course/prerequisites), notifying users about [live sessions](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes) and keeping them engaged with your content. Whether you are running a large-scale learning platform or a small niche course, email campaigns help you maintain consistent communication and drive user engagement.

## Managing user groups in Fermion

User groups in Fermion are a way to organize your learners or users into logical segments. These groups can be based on course enrollment, subscription plans, engagement level, or any other criteria that make sense for your platform. By using user groups, you can efficiently target specific audiences when sending marketing campaigns, granting product access, or automating onboarding processes.

<Tip>
You can use user groups to send personalized marketing emails, bulk assign or remove access to courses or products, and ensure that messages reach the right set of users.
</Tip>

### Creating and managing user groups
<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to User Groups">
    Head over to <strong>Marketing Tools</strong> in your Instructor Dashboard sidebar and click on <strong>User Groups</strong>. Here, you can either edit an existing user group or create a new one by clicking the **Create user group** button.

    Now, you can start adding users to these groups either directly or with the help of product enrollments. Any user who has access to the product added in the user group will be added to the user group.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add users directly">
    You can add users individually by providing the following details:  

    `Name` – The full name of the user.  
    `Email` – The user’s email address, required for login and communication.  
    `Phone Number` (Optional) – User’s contact number, used for notifications or verification.  
    `Password` (Optional) – The user’s password; if left blank, a secure password will be auto-generated.  
    `User Creation Timestamp` (Optional) – The date and time when the user account was created.  
    ![](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/13-10-2025/single%20user%20import.zqyyya.png)

    You can select the creation date, enable a welcome email, and set a custom default transactional email sender. Users imported this way can also be auto-enrolled in products and added to selected groups. Users without accounts will automatically receive their password and access details via email.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Bulk import via CSV">
    Alternatively, you can upload a CSV file containing user data to import multiple users at once. The CSV should include these columns:  

    `Email` (required) – The user’s email address, required for login and communication.  
    `Name` (optional) – The full name of the user.  
    `Password` (optional, auto-generated if blank) – The user’s password; if left blank, a secure password will be automatically generated.  
    `Phone Number` (optional) – User’s contact number, used for notifications or verification.  
`   `Created At` (optional) – The date and time when the user account was created.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add users via product enrollment">
    You can also add users to a group by enrolling them in a product. All users enrolled in that product will automatically be added to the user group.  
    Click on **Add products to group** button and add the required product's user base to the group.

  </Step>

</Steps>

Once your user group is created and populated with users, it is ready to be used in email marketing campaigns. You can assign this user group to a new or existing campaign, ensuring that your emails reach the intended audience.
