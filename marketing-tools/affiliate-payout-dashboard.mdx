Users can see their accumulated affiliate commission amount in a dedicated dashboard from which they can request payouts directly to their bank account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Affiliate Dashboard">
    From your user dashboard, click on **Affiliate dashboard** to access your affiliate payout dashboard.

    ![Access affiliate dashboard](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/11-12-2025/Arc_rz7RbL7K25.rhniue.png)
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Dashboard Sections">
    You will see a dashboard with the following sections:

    **Earnings Section:**
    - Shows total **Eligible Earnings** - the amount you can withdraw
    - Shows total **Unsettled Sales** - sales that are still in the waiting period

    **Bank Account Section:**
    - If not configured, users are prompted to add their account details
    - Users cannot request payouts without adding bank account details first

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Bank Account">
    Once bank account details are added and users have some eligible amount, the same will be shown up on the dashboard:

    - **Bank account configured** status is displayed with account type (e.g., Indian Account)
    - Masked bank account details are shown (Name, Email, Account number, IFSC, PAN)
    - **Request Payout** button becomes available when you have eligible earnings

  </Step>

  <Step title="View Payout Request History">
    Once a user requests payout, the request is shown with a new section called **Payout Request History**:

    The payout history table displays:
    - **Date**: When the payout was requested
    - **Gross Amount**: Total commission amount before deductions
    - **TDS**: Tax Deducted at Source (if applicable)
    - **Net Payout**: Final amount after TDS deduction
    - **Status**: Current status of the payout (e.g., Processing, Completed)
    - **Actions**: Options to view details or hide the earnings breakdown

    You can expand each payout request to view the **Earnings Breakdown**, which shows:
    - **Product**: Name of the course/product
    - **Sale Date**: When the sale occurred
    - **Commission**: Individual commission amount for each sale

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Your Sales Data

The dashboard includes an accordion section that explains different sales statuses:

- **New sales**: Sales that have just happened and will remain in this status for about 15 days. After 15 days, if not refunded, they become valid sales.

- **Valid sales**: Sales that have passed the 15-day waiting period and are confirmed. These can be withdrawn as part of your affiliate earnings.

- **Refunded sales**: Sales that have been refunded by customers. These do not count towards your affiliate earnings and cannot be withdrawn.

## Affiliate Links Section

The **Affiliate Links** section shows links of all the courses/products that you are eligible to generate affiliate links for. Each product has:
- A unique affiliate link that you can share
- Commission percentage for that product
- Real-time sales data (new, valid, and refunded sales)

## Products to Show Affiliate Links For

If enabled by the instructor, the **Products to show affiliate links for** section allows you to generate affiliate links for products you are not enrolled in. This feature expands your ability to promote and earn commissions from a wider range of courses and digital products.

3. Click the **Request Payout** button
4. Your payout request will be processed and appear in the Payout Request History
