Fermion allows instructors to opt in to generate AI-powered captions for recorded videos, which are automatically created in the same language used in the video.

This feature enhances accessibility for students and makes your content more inclusive. The captions are automatically synchronized with the video timeline and can be toggled on or off by viewers. There is a brief processing time for captions to be generated, which depends on the duration of the video.

To enable captions for a specific recorded video, follow these steps:
1. Go to Courses
2. Select your course
3. Open the Course Builder
4. Navigate to the recorded video you want to add captions to
5. Click on the video settings
6. Enable the `AI Transcripts` option to generate AI Transcripts
