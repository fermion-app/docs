Fermion allows you to upload unlimited recorded videos. We transcode and transcribe them once you upload, to provide optimal delivery to end users.

Here is what you get with Fermion:

-   360p, 480p, 720p and 1080p resolution playbacks
-   HLS streaming playback
-   Rich video player
-   Ability to embed the video externally
-   Ability to turn on DRM protection for playback
-   Ability to generate transcripts for your recorded videos.

### Generate Transcripts
This is an opt-in feature that automatically transcribes your recorded videos. Once generaed, the transcripts are available as closed captions, which are directly added to the video player.

This option is also available as a global setting for your school at: Settings > School settings > Recorded video settings.
