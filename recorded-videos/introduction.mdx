Fermion allows you to upload unlimited recorded videos. We transcode and transcribe them once you upload, to provide optimal delivery to end users.

Here is what you get with Fermion:

-   360p, 480p, 720p and 1080p resolution playbacks
-   HLS streaming playback
-   Rich video player
-   Ability to embed the video externally
-   Ability to turn on DRM protection for playback

### Video watermarking

Add a moving, viewer-specific watermark to deter unauthorized sharing / recording of your content.

-   **Where to find it**: Dashboard > Settings > School Settings > Enable Video Watermarking

**Setup**

1.   Toggle "Enable video watermarking".
2.   Set **Font Size** (px) and **Opacity** (%) to your preference.
3.   Choose which identifiers to display:
    -   Name
    -   Email Address
    -   Phone Number
    -   User ID
4.   Review the live preview, then select "Save security settings".
