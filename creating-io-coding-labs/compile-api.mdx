The **Compile API** allows you to execute arbitrary code in a secure, sandboxed environment directly through Fermion’s backend. This is ideal for online coding exercises, testing snippets, or building coding playgrounds on your platform.

You can send a POST request with your source code and configuration details, and the API returns the program’s output, error messages, and execution metadata, right inside your instructor dashboard.

Before you start, make sure **Coding labs** are enabled under **Manage Features** in your instructor dashboard. Learn how to enable features at Fermion [here](/manage-settings/manage-features)

After accessing this section, you will be presented with the following two panes: 

<Columns cols={2}>

  <Card title="Write and Run Code">
    On the left side, you can write and edit your source code in the built-in editor using any of the supported languages. 
    Simply choose the language from the dropdown and click **Run code** to execute it securely in Fermion’s sandboxed environment.
  </Card>

  <Card title="API Preview">
    On the right side, you can view the automatically generated **cURL request**: showing exactly how to call the Fermion Compile API programmatically.

## Example usage

Here’s a sample `curl` request to execute a C++ code to compute sum of two variables:

```bash
curl -X POST https://backend.codedamn.com/api/public/request-dsa-code-execution \
 -H 'content-type: application/json' \
 -H 'fermion-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
 -d '{

   }
  }
 ]
}'
```
