Fermion allows you to add IO coding labs. IO coding labs are powerful labs that can run the following languages:

-   C
-   C++
-   C#/.NET 8
-   Go
-   Java
-   MySQL
-   Node.js (JavaScript)
-   Python
-   Rust
-   SQLite

IO coding labs are available to be used within the platform directly, or by embedding it.
