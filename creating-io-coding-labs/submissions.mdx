## Understanding the Submissions Table

The Submissions History table displays comprehensive information about each code submission:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **DATE** | The date and time when the submission was made |
| **STATUS** | The overall result of the submission (e.g., Full Correct, Wrong Answer) |
| **LANGUAGE** | The programming language used for the submission |
| **RUNTIME** | The execution time of the code in milliseconds |
| **MEMORY** | The memory consumed during code execution |
| **TEST CASES** | The number of test cases passed (e.g., 1/1, 0/1) |

## Submission Status Types

Each submission displays a status that indicates the outcome of the code execution:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Full Correct" icon="check-circle">
    All test cases passed successfully. The solution is correct.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Wrong Answer" icon="times-circle">
    The code executed successfully but produced incorrect output for one or more test cases.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Viewing Submission Details

Click on any submission entry in the table to view detailed information about that specific submission, including:

- Complete source code that was submitted
- Individual test case results
- Execution logs and error messages (if any)
- Performance metrics breakdown

<Info>
	Submissions History helps learners track their progress, identify patterns in
	their solutions, and learn from previous attempts.
</Info>

<Tip>
	Instructors can also view submission history for all learners from the lab
	management interface to monitor class progress and identify common issues.
