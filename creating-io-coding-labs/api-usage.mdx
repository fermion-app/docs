The DSA Coding Lab Execution API allows you to programmatically execute code submissions and retrieve results for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. This API supports batch operations for efficiency and handles multiple programming languages.

## Overview

The API provides four main endpoints which you can utilize to execute DSA coding labs over Fermion API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin using the DSA Execution API, make sure you’ve set up the following essential components.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fermion API Key" icon="key">
    You must have a valid Fermion API key to run these coding labs. Create a Fermion account and go to **Settings → API access** in your instructor dashboard to get the key.  
    Learn how to get your [API key here](/api-guide/introduction#how-to-get-your-api-key).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Base64URL Encoded source code" icon="code">
    Base64URL encoding is **critical** for proper API usage.  
    The DSA execution API requires Base64URL encoding (not standard Base64) for several fields including **source code**, **expected output**, **stdin input**, and **file attachments** for [SQL labs](/creating-io-coding-labs/sql-over-api).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

#### Why Base64URL Encoding?
Base64URL encoding is a URL-safe variant of the standard Base64 format. It’s designed to ensure that encoded data can be safely transmitted in URLs, JSON, and APIs without introducing reserved or invalid characters.

Base64URL encoding is a URL-safe variant of Base64 that:

-   Replaces `+` with `-` (dash)
-   Replaces `/` with `_` (underscore)
-   Removes padding `=` characters
-   Ensures the encoded string is safe for use in URLs and JSON

<Warning>
	Using standard Base64 encoding instead of Base64URL will cause API errors or
	unexpected behavior. Always use Base64URL encoding for the API. Learn more about [Base64URL encoding](https://b64encode.com/blog/base64url-guide/)
</Warning>

## Supported languages

Fermion currently supports the following runtimes for code execution:

<Columns cols={4}>
  <Card title="C / C++" icon="C"></Card>
  <Card title="Java" icon="java"></Card>
  <Card title="Python" icon="python"></Card>
  <Card title="Node.js (JavaScript)" icon="node-js"></Card>
  <Card title="SQLite / MySQL 8" icon="database"></Card>
  <Card title="Go (1.19)" icon="golang"></Card>
  <Card title="Rust (1.87)" icon="rust"></Card>
  <Card title=".NET 8" icon="hashtag"></Card>
</Columns>


Each language runs in a secure, isolated container with seperate resources.

## How to execute IO/DSA labs over API?

You can utilize the following steps to execute DSA over API. If you wish to test how a request is structured for any given language, head over to the [compile API](/creating-io-coding-labs/api-usage#how-does-compile-api-work%3F) section of this documentation to learn more.

<Steps>
<Step title='Submit code for execution'>

Use the **Request DSA code execution [batch]** endpoint to submit one or more code executions.

For detailed API specification, request/response schemas, and interactive examples, see the official API documentation: [Request DSA code execution [batch]](https://docs.fermion.app/api-reference/dsa/request-dsa-code-execution-[batch])

Here is an empty sample request body for executing C code over API. Head over to the [runConfig documentation](/creating-io-coding-labs/api-usage#run-configuration-runconfig) to know more about each field

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "data": {
        "entries": [
          {
            "language": "C",
            "runConfig": {
              "customMatcherToUseForExpectedOutput": "ExactMatch",
              "expectedOutputAsBase64UrlEncoded": "",
              "stdinStringAsBase64UrlEncoded": "",
              "callbackUrlOnExecutionCompletion": "",
              "shouldEnablePerProcessAndThreadCpuTimeLimit": false,
              "shouldEnablePerProcessAndThreadMemoryLimit": false,
              "shouldAllowInternetAccess": false,
              "compilerFlagString": "",
              "maxFileSizeInKilobytesFilesCreatedOrModified": 51200,
              "stackSizeLimitInKilobytes": 65536,
              "cpuTimeLimitInMilliseconds": 2000,
              "wallTimeLimitInMilliseconds": 5000,
              "memoryLimitInKilobyte": 512000,
              "maxProcessesAndOrThreads": 60
            },
            "sourceCodeAsBase64UrlEncoded": "",
            "additionalFilesAsZip": {
              "type": "base64url-encoding",
              "base64UrlEncodedZip": ""
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Special Case: SQLite

For SQLite code execution, you must include a ZIP file containing a `db.sqlite` file:

```json
{
	"language": "Sqlite_3_48_0",
	"sourceCodeAsBase64UrlEncoded": "U0VMRUNUIEhFTExPKCk=",
	"additionalFilesAsZip": {
		"type": "base64url-encoding",
		"base64UrlEncodedZip": "base64-encoded-zip-content"
	},
	"runConfig": {
		// ... other config
	}
}
```
Learn more about [executing sql queries over API](/creating-io-coding-labs/sql-over-api)


The API returns an array of task IDs in the same order of challenges that you submitted, that you can use to retrieve results later.

```json
{
    "output": 
	{
      "status": "ok",
      "data": 
	  {
        "taskIds": [ "<string>"]
      }
    }
}
```


</Step>

<Step title="Retrieve execution results">

Use the **Get DSA code execution result [batch]** endpoint to retrieve results of submitted executions. You will have to pass the Fermion API key so that we can authenticate your request

Here's a sample cURL request to get the execution results of the task IDs returned from the previous endpoint

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://backend.codedamn.com/api/public/get-dsa-code-execution-result-batch \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'FERMION-API-KEY: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "data": [
    {
      "data": {
        "taskUniqueIds": [
          "<string>"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


For detailed API specification, request/response schemas, and interactive examples, see the official API documentation: [Get DSA code execution result [batch]](https://docs.fermion.app/api-reference/dsa/get-dsa-code-execution-result-[batch])


</Step>

</Steps>

## Using webhook URLs for instant results (recommended)

    Instead of polling for results, it's recommended to use the`callbackUrlOnExecutionCompletion` parameter in your `runConfig`. This
    webhook URL will receive a POST request with the execution results immediately when processing completes, eliminating the need for repeated
    polling and providing faster response times.

<Tip>
	When using webhook URLs, include the `callbackUrlOnExecutionCompletion` in
	your execution request
</Tip>

```json
{
	"language": "Python",
	"sourceCodeAsBase64UrlEncoded": "cHJpbnQoImhlbGxvIHdvcmxkIik=",
	"runConfig": {
		"callbackUrlOnExecutionCompletion": "https://your-domain.com/webhook/execution-complete",
		"customMatcherToUseForExpectedOutput": "ExactMatch",
		"expectedOutputAsBase64UrlEncoded": "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQK",
		"cpuTimeLimitInMilliseconds": 2000,
		"wallTimeLimitInMilliseconds": 5000,
		"memoryLimitInKilobyte": 131072
	}
}
```
Your webhook endpoint will receive the complete execution result as a POST request body, containing the same data structure as the batch result API response.

---

The **Compile API** allows you to execute arbitrary code in a secure, sandboxed environment directly through Fermion’s backend. This is ideal for online coding exercises, testing snippets, or building coding playgrounds on your platform.

You can send a POST request with your source code and configuration details, and the API returns the program’s output, error messages, and execution metadata, right inside your instructor dashboard.
