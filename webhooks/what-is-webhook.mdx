description: Understand how Fermion webhooks work and how you can integrate them in your system
---
Webhooks let you integrate Fermion with external systems by sending real-time notifications 
when specific events occur in your courses or labs. You can now create multiple webhooks and subscribe each one to selected events, 
ensuring notifications are sent only to the systems that need them.

# Understanding Webhooks

A **webhook** is a way for Fermion to send real-time notifications to an external system when something happens in your courses, labs, live events, or digital products.  

Unlike APIs where your system must **poll** for updates, webhooks **push data automatically** to a URL you specify.

Think of it like Fermion “knocking on your server’s door” whenever an important event occurs.  
This allows your system to respond immediately without constantly checking for changes.

## Why use Webhooks?

Webhooks are useful for **automation** and keeping external systems in sync with your Fermion platform. Common use cases include:

-  **CRM Notifications** – Notify a CRM when a student enrolls or interacts with a course.  
-  **Accounting Updates** – Update accounting software when a payment is completed.  
-  **Marketing Automation** – Trigger marketing workflows based on user activity.  
-  **Student Experience** – Provide third-party solutions to students automatically.
