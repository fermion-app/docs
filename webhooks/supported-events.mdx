description: Overview of all webhook events currently supported in Fermion.
---

Fermion currently supports a variety of webhook events that allow your external systems to stay in sync with activities on the platform.  
Each event represents a specific action or change in your courses, labs, live events, or digital products, and is delivered in real-time to your configured webhook endpoint.

By subscribing to the appropriate events, you can automate workflows, trigger notifications, and integrate seamlessly with third-party systems. For example, you could automatically update your CRM when a user enrolls, or trigger post-processing scripts when a live event video is ready.
