Webhooks let Fermion send event notifications directly to your server.  
Follow these steps to set up your first webhook:

## Setting Up a Webhook

1. **Go to Webhooks Settings**  
   Open the **Webhooks** page in your Fermion dashboard.

2. **Create a Webhook**  
   Click **Add a new webhook** to create a new webhook template.

3. **Add Your Webhook URL**  
   Enter your server endpoint URL that will handle incoming webhook events and payload.

4. **Set a Webhook Secret**  
   Ensure the integrity of your webhook events by setting a secret. This secret will be sent in every webhook event in a header named `X-Fermion-Webhook-Secret`. 
   Your server must validate all incoming requests and check if this header is present with the correct value.

<Warning>
Treat your webhook URL as a **secure endpoint**.  Only accept requests that contain the correct Fermion webhook secret.
</Warning>


5. **Subscribe to Events**  
   Choose the events you want this webhook to listen to. More information on events is provided in next sections.

6.  **Save Configuration**  
    Click on Save Configuration to update your webhook settings.

## Multiple Webhooks & Event Subscriptions

You can create **multiple webhooks**, each subscribed to different events.  
This lets you send specific notifications to the right system.

**Examples:**
- Webhook 1 → Lab events → Sends data to an analytics system.  
- Webhook 2 → Payment events → Sends data to accounting software.  
- Webhook 3 → Captions → Sends caption data to your DB.  

### Example Webhook Configuration

| Webhook   | Subscribed Events                 | Purpose                                               |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Webhook 1 | Lab Run Tests                     | Send lab results to an analytics system.              |
| Webhook 2 | Paid Product Sale, Payment Failed | Update accounting software with sales data.           |
| Webhook 3 | Live Event Session Caption Ready  | Automatically process captions for integration.   |

<Tip>
Using multiple webhooks keeps your integrations **organized, secure, and efficient**, since each system only receives the events it needs.
