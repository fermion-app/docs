## 1. Lab Run Tests
  
**Event Trigger:** When a user clicks the "Run Tests" button in a lab.

Fermion’s interactive coding labs are full-fledged environments that boot up quick and give learners 
a near VSCode-like developer experience directly in the browser. These labs include an editor, terminal, preview window, 
and dedicated challenge sections so students can learn by doing, not just by watching.

To gather more information about Coding Labs, you can navigate to [What are Coding Labs](/creating-coding-labs/what-are-coding-labs)

By integrating the Lab Run Tests webhook, you can capture when learners attempt or complete challenges, 
track their progress, and feed the results into grading systems, analytics dashboards, or custom reporting tools.

```tsx
type FermionWebhookEventLabRunTestsType = {
  eventUniqueId: string;

  } & {
    internalUserId: string;
