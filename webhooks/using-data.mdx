description: How to process Fermion webhook data and access event logs.
---


When your server receives a webhook from Fermion, follow these practices to ensure reliable and secure processing:

1. **Verify the `X-Fermion-Webhook-Secret` header**  
   This ensures that the webhook request is authentic and actually sent by Fermion.

2. **Log `eventUniqueId`**  
   Each webhook event has a globally unique ID. Logging this helps prevent processing the same event multiple times.

3. **Use `timestampIsoString`**  
   This timestamp indicates when the event occurred. It is useful for ordering events chronologically or detecting delayed deliveries.

4. **Check `isTestEvent`**  
   Fermion allows you to send test events from the dashboard. Use this flag to distinguish between test and live events in your system.

5. **Process the `payload`**  
   The `payload` contains event-specific data. Handle it according to the event type for your workflow or automation.

<Tip>
Always validate the webhook secret and log the `eventUniqueId`. This prevents duplicates and ensures your integrations remain secure and reliable.

# Accessing Webhook Event Logs

Fermion logs all webhook events, making it easy to monitor and troubleshoot your integrations:

- Navigate to the **Webhook** page in your dashboard and scroll further to view **Event Logs**.  
- You can **view event details**, **copy data**, or **re-trigger the webhook** if your endpoint missed the original request.  
- Each event shows the complete payload and metadata, so you can inspect exactly what was sent.

<Info>
If an event fails to be processed, re-triggering it from the Event Logs is a quick way to recover without waiting for the next occurrence.

# Exporting Event Logs

For bulk analysis or backups, Fermion allows you to export event logs:

1. Click the **Export Data** button on the Event Logs page.  
2. Select the **time range** and **specific events** you want to export.  
3. The data will be exported as a **CSV file** and downloaded immediately to your device.  

<Tip>
Exporting event logs is useful for running scripts, audits, or keeping offline records of all webhook activity.
