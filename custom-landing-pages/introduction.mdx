## What is a custom page?

A custom page on Fermion is a fully user-controlled page. You can either write and upload your own HTML/CSS/JS, or use a no-code tool like WordPress to design your page visually. Fermion will host and serve your page exactly as you design it.

## How to create a custom page in Fermion

You have two main options:

-   **No-code service (e.g., WordPress):** Use intuitive drag-and-drop tools to build your page without writing code.
-   **Static website upload:** Develop your page with your preferred tools, then upload the source code to Fermion for hosting.
