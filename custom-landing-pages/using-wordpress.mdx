Fermion allows you to use **WordPress** to manage pages on your website. Please note the following things before getting started:

-   WordPress is used only for page building for your convenience. Your real website on Fermion is not served via WordPress.

-   Custom pages you build inside WordPress automatically gets published via Fermion when you Sync WordPress with Fermion.

-   Make sure to Sync WordPress with Fermion whenever you want to make all changes live on your website. Without that, your WordPress changes will not be synced and will be lost on refresh.

-   This is a temporary WordPress instance. If you don't use it for 20-30 minutes, the instance will be killed.
