Blogs in Fermion are a powerful way to share knowledge, updates, tutorials, or announcements with your audience. Whether you want to post educational content for your students, share organizational news, or highlight success stories, blogs provide a structured and visually appealing way to communicate.

Each blog supports Markdown formatting, allowing you to style your text, include images, and even add code snippets. Additionally, SEO settings like custom URL slugs and categories help your blogs reach a wider audience, while thumbnails and categories make it easier for readers to discover and navigate your content.

Blogs are hosted directly on your **domain**, so your learners and audience can read them without visiting any third-party platform. This ensures a complete branded experience while keeping all your content centralized.

## How blogs differ from in-course articles

Unlike in-course articles, which are tied to a specific course and can only be accessed by learners enrolled in that course, blogs in Fermion are standalone content pieces that live on your own domain. This means they can be shared publicly across the internet, making it easy for anyone to discover and read them. 

Blogs give you the flexibility to reach a wider audience, showcase your expertise, promote courses or resources, and share updates or educational content in a professional, branded way.
