Fermion's AI Builder allows you to create fully customized landing pages by simply describing what you want. The AI will generate a complete page for you, which you can then refine with real-time data, direct checkout links, and custom paths.

This powerful no-code tool eliminates the need for manual HTML/CSS/JavaScript coding, making it easy for anyone to create professional landing pages in minutes.

## How AI Builder Works

The AI Builder uses advanced language models to understand your requirements and generate complete, functional landing pages. You can:

- Describe your page in natural language
- Let the AI generate the complete page structure and design
- Refine the page with real-time data integration
- Add direct checkout links with proper interlinking
- Customize the page path and publish instantly

<Steps>

<Step title="Navigate to Custom Pages">

</Step>

<Step title="Interact with the AI">
Describe the type of landing page you want to create. You can specify:
- The purpose of the page (e.g., course landing page, product sales page)
- The design style you prefer
- Key sections you want to include
- Any specific features or elements

The AI will understand your requirements and generate a complete static page structure.

</Step>

<Step title="Wait for AI to Build Your Page">
The AI will process your request and generate a complete landing page. This may take a few moments as the AI creates all the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

</Step>

<Step title="Refine Your Page">
Once the AI has generated your page, you can refine it by:
- Adding real-time data integration
- Adding direct checkout links with proper interlinking
- Customizing the design and layout
- Adjusting content and messaging

<Info>
You can add direct checkout links using the format `/api/buy-digital-product?product-slug=YOUR_PRODUCT_SLUG`. For more details on checkout links, see the [Direct Checkout Links](/custom-landing-pages/checkout-page-direct-links) guide.

</Step>

<Step title="Add a Custom Path">
Assign a custom path to your page (e.g., `/landingpage`, `/course-intro`, `/product-sales`). This will be the URL where your page will be accessible.

</Step>

<Step title="Publish Your Page">
Click on the **Publish** button to make your page live. Once published, your page will be accessible at the custom path you specified.

</Step>

## Managing Published Pages

Once your page is published, you can:

- **View the page**: Click to see how your page appears to visitors
- **Unpublish the page**: Temporarily remove the page from public access without deleting it
- **Edit the page**: Make further refinements and republish

## Best Practices

- **Be specific in your AI prompts**: The more details you provide about what you want, the better the AI can generate your page
- **Test checkout links**: Always verify that direct checkout links work correctly before publishing
- **Review the generated code**: While the AI generates functional code, you may want to review and customize it further
- **Use meaningful paths**: Choose descriptive paths that reflect the purpose of your page
- **Iterate and refine**: Don't hesitate to ask the AI to make adjustments or regenerate sections

<Tip>
The AI Builder is perfect for quickly prototyping landing pages. For more advanced customization, you can always export the generated code and modify it manually, or use the [Source Code](/custom-landing-pages/using-source-code) method for complete control.
