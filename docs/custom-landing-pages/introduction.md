# Creating a custom landing page on Fermion

A custom landing page is a great way to drive traffic and attention with a specific campaign for your brand.

Fermion allows you to build your own custom landing pages in two ways:

-   Using website builder (no-code)
-   Using source code

Fermion comes with stock template pages by default. For most cases, that is sufficient to get started without any additional customizations.

However, you can always build your own variation of marketing/sales/home page where you can:

-   Run A/B test experiments
-   Have different landing pages for different mediums
-   Want to quantify the conversion rate, bounce rate, etc.

Among many other things. This document lists how you can build a custom page on Fermion.
