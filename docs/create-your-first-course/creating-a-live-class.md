# Creating a live class

*It's time to create your first live class! Before we jump in, let's learn a little more about what are live classes on Fermion.*

## Introduction

As an online creator, teaching live online can be one of the biggest bottlenecks, especially when you need high-quality video and smooth interactions.

If you’re planning to teach online, you probably have realized that the easiest way is by using softwares like Google Meet, Webex, Zoom, etc. But these softwares drill a hole inside your pocket the moment you scale.

So you essentially want a tool that provides the same, buttery-smooth experience without hurting your pocket, which is exactly what Fermions serves you with.

Fermion simplifies this by offering built-in live class capabilities, eliminating the need for third-party applications like Zoom. This not only provides a seamless experience but also reduces additional costs and setup hassles.

Fermion’s in-house infrastructure ensures a smooth, uninterrupted teaching experience, making it easier for you to focus on delivering their content effectively.



## Some pre-requisites

Before getting started, make sure of the following things:

1. Have a good internet connection before you stream so that the stream doesn't buffer or lag, these issues are usually caused by poor network connections. 

2. Keep a good webcam and a good microphone to ensure that you're able to stream smoothly to your learners.
