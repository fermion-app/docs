If we had to summarise payouts in two words, we’d say it’s easy and flexible.

You get paid, as you want and when you want.

Fermion gives you the option to receive payouts daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or bi-monthly. It reduced any hassle by managing payments for you so you can focus on doing what you do the best.

To keep a track of your payouts, head to the "Payouts" section on the left sidebar inside your dashboard view. You will see a screen like below, where you can see the basic details such as your upcoming payout, as well as your other payouts processed in the past. 

To request a payout, simply reach out to your Fermion relationship manager and let them know. Additionally, you can also reach out to us at [support@codedamn.com](mailto:support@codedamn.com)
