## Why create a platform like Fermion?

While we were talking to multiple creators in the industry, they all shared the same experiences with various LMS platforms.

Some shared that the support provided isn’t up to the mark, some said that their user interface isn’t good, while others had issues with their live streaming.

To simply put why we’re building Fermion, is to eliminate problems exactly like these.

The best creators and educators in the world, shouldn’t have to worry about small bugs and issues. They should spend their time providing the best education, which is what we tell instructors when they join us.

Our vision is simple – to help technical creators set up their online academies so they don’t have to worry about anything else other than providing the best education.

With Fermion, we’re building the best experience for creators and their audiences.
