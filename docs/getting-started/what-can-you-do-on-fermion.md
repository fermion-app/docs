# What can you do on Fermion? 

Fermion is built primarily for technical instructors.

There are many things you can do with this tool, but at its core, Fermion lets you create interactive cohorts through hands-on interactive and evaluative coding labs, projects, and interview kits.

Not only this but as an instructor, you would be able to see every detail of your student’s learning journey.

*Let’s get into the details*

We’ll go through each feature in depth:

1. Cohort-based Courses
2. Online Coaching (Live)
3. Online Coding Labs and Assessments
4. Data Transparency and Digital Protection
5. Payment Gateways
6. Multiple Instructors and Co-teaching

## Cohort-based Courses
Fermion gives you the flexibility to create courses the way you want.

On Fermion, you can choose to create Recorded Courses, Cohort-based Courses, even a Hybrid Course, Workshops and so much more, depending on which audience you wish to cater.

Cohorts on Fermion, are structured through a weekly curriculum that can include live classes and pre-recorded lectures. 

This setup allows you to have complete control over how your courses are organized. You can mix and match pre-recorded lectures and live classes to create a hybrid learning experience.

Each cohort comes with a clear start date, end date, and enrolment deadline, ensuring a well-defined timeline for both you and your students.

## Online Coaching (Live)
As an online creator, teaching live online can be one of the biggest bottlenecks, especially when you need high-quality video and smooth interactions.

If you’re planning to teach online, you probably have realized that the easiest way is by using softwares like Google Meet, Webex, Zoom, etc. But these softwares drill a hole inside your pocket the moment you scale.

So you essentially want a tool that provides the same, buttery-smooth experience without hurting your pocket, which is exactly what Fermions serves you with.

Fermion simplifies this by offering built-in live class capabilities, eliminating the need for third-party applications like Zoom. This not only provides a seamless experience but also reduces additional costs and setup hassles.

Fermion’s in-house infrastructure ensures a smooth, uninterrupted teaching experience, making it easier for you to focus on delivering their content effectively.

We'll discuss more about how to get started with Live Classes in detail, as we move deeper into the course. 

## Online Coding Labs and Assessments
*Another mind-boggling reason why Fermion stands out among other traditional LMS platforms is its ability to integrate interactive coding labs at the click of a button!*

We believe in the philosophy of learning by doing, and we’ve brought the same concept to Fermion by letting technical instructors integrate hands-on interactive and evaluative coding labs in seconds.

This helps your courses stand out in the market by offering a practical learning experience that is crucial for aspiring developers.

Not just this, you can go beyond and even add hands-on coding projects as well as interview kits inside your courses.

Interesting enough, eh?
