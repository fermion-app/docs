# Fermion v/s Other Platforms

Fermion has been created specifically for technical instructors. Our top priority is to serve you with a beautiful, seamless experience. A lot of traditional LMS focus on online creators in general, but that’s not who we are. Our focus lies solely on technical creators, and that is why the best use cases on Fermion are designed for technical creators.

## Why do a lot of technical creators choose Fermion?

There are a lot of other platforms like Graphy, Kajabi, Thinkific, Teachable, Rigi or TagMango, and in this quick read, we'll talk about why a lot of technical creators choose Fermion to build their courses:

## Online teaching

Fermion gives you the ability to take live classes at a no additional cost, unlike other platforms where you’re required to integrate with services like Google Meet, Webex, or Zoom with heavy costs. We know how essential live teaching is for online creators which is why you need to choose a platform which not just gives you a beautiful and premium experience, but also doesn't break your bank. When you teach on services like Zoom or Google Meet, the cost expontentially increases as you scale your business, but that doesn't happy on Fermion.

Fermion lets you teach to approximately 10,000 students at no additional cost. Exciting, right?
