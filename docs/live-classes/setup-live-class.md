# Creating a live class

## Some pre-requisites

Before getting started, make sure of the following things:

1. Have a good internet connection before you stream so that the stream doesn't buffer or lag, these issues are usually caused by poor network connections.

2. Keep a good webcam and a good microphone to ensure that you're able to stream smoothly to your learners.
