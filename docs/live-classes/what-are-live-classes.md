# Live classes on Fermion

## Introduction

Live streaming is a process through which you can go live in front of your enrolled users for a specific cohort or course.

As an online creator, teaching live online can be one of the biggest bottlenecks, especially when you need high-quality video and smooth interactions at an affordable price.

Fermion offers built-in live class capabilities, eliminating the need for third-party applications like Zoom. This not only provides a seamless experience but also reduces additional costs and setup hassles.

Fermionâ€™s in-house infrastructure ensures a smooth, uninterrupted teaching experience, making it easier for you to focus on delivering their content effectively.
