# What is content library?

The content library is a repository of reusable educational materials that you can use in your course. It can include quizzes or coding labs (interactive and DSA/IO based, both). The content library also allows you to store and organize your questions efficiently, making it easy to integrate them into multiple courses.

## How can I use the content library?

This content library is available to all instructors on a `Pro` plan, and includes over 5000+ questions which you can add with the click of a button.
