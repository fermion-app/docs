## What are Bundles?

Bundles let you combine multiple digital products, including [courses](/setting-up-course/prerequisites), [eBooks](/digital-products/introduction), contests, [downloadable resources](/digital-products/downloadable-products), and [live events](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes) into a single package. They make it easy to offer more value to your learners while simplifying how you sell and manage your products.

You can use bundles to create a complete learning path, offer a discounted collection of premium courses, or launch a special promo pack. You can even use bundles to provide **All product access** to students. Everything is neatly presented under one landing page, giving students a way to explore and purchase everything they need.

## Create a Bundle

Every bundle comes with its own landing page, which acts as your storefront for that package.
This page showcases everything the bundle includes, [pricing](/setup-pricing/fixed-pricing-plan) of the bundle and a short description about it. This gives learners a clear idea of what they’ll gain access to.
