Tags help instructors categorize and organize their course items more effectively. By assigning tags (like **“JavaScript”**, **“Advanced”**, or **“Optional”**) to lectures, quizzes, or assignments, students can easily filter and find the content that’s most relevant to them.  

For example, you can label lessons by difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**, or by topic: **Frontend**, **Backend**, **Databases**, allowing learners to quickly navigate through large course syllabus.

### How learners can use tags

From a learner’s perspective, tags make course navigation simpler and more intuitive by allowing students to easily **filter** by clicking on the tag and discover content based on their learning preferences or current progress.

For example, if lessons are categorized by difficulty, learners can start with `Easy` lessons to build a strong foundation and then gradually move on to `Medium` or `Hard` tagged lessons as they advance through the course. Similarly, topic-based tags like `JavaScript`, `React`, or `Backend` let learners focus on areas that interest them the most.

By effectively using tags, instructors create a more personalized and accessible learning experience for everyone.
