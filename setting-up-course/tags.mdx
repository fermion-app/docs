Tags help instructors categorize and organize both their courses and course items more effectively. By assigning tags such as **“Web Development”, “DSA”, or “Design”** to an entire course, you can group related content and make it easier for learners to browse by category when visiting your school website.

Similarly, tags can be applied to individual course items like [videos](/recorded-videos/introduction), quizzes, or [assignments](/setting-up-course/assignments) to help students filter and find the most relevant materials. For example, you can label lessons by difficulty: **Easy, Medium, Hard**, or by topic: **Frontend, Backend, Databases**, allowing learners to quickly navigate through large course syllabi.

In the following sections, you will learn how we can apply tags to courses and individual course items.

### How learners can use tags for course items

From a learner’s perspective, tags make course navigation simpler and more intuitive by allowing students to easily **filter** by clicking on the tag and discover content based on their learning preferences or current progress.

For example, if lessons are categorized by difficulty, learners can start with `Easy` lessons to build a strong foundation and then gradually move on to `Medium` or `Hard` tagged lessons as they advance through the course. Similarly, topic-based tags like `JavaScript`, `React`, or `Backend` let learners focus on areas that interest them the most.

By effectively using tags, instructors create a more personalized and accessible learning experience for everyone.
