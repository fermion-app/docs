Managing your course settings allows you to customize the way your course behaves for students, control enrollment, configure completion certificates, and fine-tune additional preferences. Below is a breakdown of the available settings and how to configure them.

Navigate to the **Settings** tab in your course builder to access these course settings

## Refund policy

Refund policy settings let you decide whether students can request a refund for your course. By default, refunds are disabled, and students cannot request them from their dashboard.

## Completion certificate

You can configure whether your course issues a **certificate of completion** and customize its design. Certificates can be automatically generated with AI or uploaded using a custom HTML template.

## Rating reminder

Rating reminders allow you to send automatic emails to students asking them to rate your course. By default, the email is sent on the 10th day after a student’s enrollment.

## Enrollment settings

Enrollment settings control how students can join your course. You can restrict enrollment so only admins can manually add students, or allow open enrollment for anyone.

## Additional settings

Additional settings let you customize course preferences such as recommended completion time. If you set a recommended time, students will receive a gentle nudge if they haven’t completed the course within that period. Leaving it blank disables the nudge.

## Course discussions

Course discussions allow students to comment on individual course items and interact with peers. Enabling discussions helps build a community and encourages collaborative learning.
