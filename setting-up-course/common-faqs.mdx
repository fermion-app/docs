This document lists down some of the FAQs related to course toolings on Fermion.

### What type of courses can I create on Fermion?

You can create a recorded course or a cohort-based course (bootcamp style). A recorded course does not have the functionality for live classes and has no fixed start date or end date due to the nature of the course whereas a cohort-based course has a fixed start date, end date, and live classes inside the course.
