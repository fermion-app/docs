There are a few things to know before we dig deep:

1. If you have opted for a "Cohort Based Course", your `Manage syllabus` will look something like below. Here, you can schedule live sessions, add weekly assignments, and track student progress through the course timeline.
   ![Yhchr7tqw4PIwhUB1HQlU](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/02-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/Yhchr7tqw4PIwhUB1HQlU)

2. In case you've chosen a "Recorded Course", your `Manage syllabus` section will look like the below screenshot. This format allows you to create and organize content sections that students can access at their own pace.
   ![-UTjMT52nzhSqwBdw5TY](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/02-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/-_UTjMT52nzhSqwBdw5TY)

3. In the case of a Cohort Based Course, Fermion by-default bifurcates your cohort duration into a weekly division, so that when you prepare your syllabus, it follows a weekly format. This helps in maintaining a structured learning path for your students.

4. In the case of a Recorded Course, Fermion gives you the ability to create "Sections". In every section, you can create multiple course items. When you create a section, one empty article is created by default, as sections cannot be empty. Remember this the next time you create a recorded course to ensure all sections contain valuable content.

## What are course items?

Course items are the components you can add inside your syllabus from the Fermion syllabus manager. These include articles, videos, quizzes, coding labs, coding assessments, and more. We'll discuss more about these in the sections below.

## What is an article?

An article is a written piece of content that you can create within the course. It can include text, images, links, and other multimedia elements to explain concepts, provide instructions, or deliver information to students. Articles are ideal for detailed explanations, step-by-step guides, and reference material. The article editor provides you with a proper markdown support so you can make them beautiful!

### How do I create an article?

## What is a quiz?

A quiz is an interactive assessment tool that you can use to test your students' knowledge and understanding of the course material. Quizzes can include multiple-choice questions, true/false questions, short answers, and other formats. They help reinforce learning and provide immediate feedback to students.

### How do I create a quiz?

## What is a coding lab?

A coding lab is a hands-on programming lab that allows students to apply what they've learned in a practical setting. In a coding lab, students write and run code to solve problems or complete tasks. It provides an interactive environment for learners to practice coding skills and receive real-time feedback.

We'll learn more about coding labs in the upcoming articles and also discuss how you can build one for yourself.

## What is video?

A video is a pre-recorded visual and audio presentation that you can include in your course. Videos can be lectures, tutorials, demonstrations, or any other type of visual content that helps convey information effectively. Videos are engaging and can simplify complex topics through visual representation.

### How do I add videos?

-   Step 1: Click on the `+` button to expand the course items' view.

-   Step 5: When you click on `Add a video` it will open a new modal for you, showing you all the videos in your video library, if it is empty, it means that there are no videos in your video library. You can add videos in bulk by clicking on the `Upload videos` button.
    ![wr5keXO1dGDtOvu1R1nIW](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/02-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/wr5keXO1dGDtOvu1R1nIW)

-   Step 6: Once you add videos, it can take up to a few hours for the videos to get processed. Once your videos are processed you can click on the `Link Video` button to attach it to the current course item.

-   Step 7: So on, you can add multiple pre-recorded videos inside your course.

## What is live class?

A live class is a real-time, interactive session where you can teach students directly. During a live class, you can share your screen, present slides, engage in discussions, and answer questions on the spot. Live classes are ideal for fostering interaction and building a community among your students.

We'll learn more on how to setup a live class within your course curriculum, in the next few articles.

## What is coding assessment?

A coding assessment is a structured evaluation designed to test students' programming skills and knowledge.

Unlike coding labs, which are practice-based, coding assessments are used to grade students' performance. They typically involve solving coding problems within a set time frame and are used to measure students' proficiency.

You can also call them "interview kits", as they follow the same pattern of an interview kit, including a mix of quizzes and coding labs.

Here's how a typical assessment look like:
![cMEy0GJFODortnuZ82FO5](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/02-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/cMEy0GJFODortnuZ82FO5)

Coding assessments aren't available to everyone by default, if you wish to convert your course into an interview kit, please reach out to us at [support@codedamn.com](mailto:support@codedamn.com).

## What are SCORM packages?

SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) is a set of eLearning standards that enables course packages to run reliably across compatible learning platforms. If a package is SCORM-compliant, it can communicate progress, scores, and completion data with Fermion.

### Why should I add SCORM packages?

-   Content reusability: Integrate existing SCORM content you own or source from third parties.
-   Standardization: Use an industry standard so content behaves consistently across platforms.
-   Enhanced learning materials: Complement articles, videos, live classes, and labs with interactive SCORM modules.

## What is content library?

The content library is a repository of reusable educational materials that you can use in your course. It can include quizzes or coding labs (interactive and DSA/IO based, both). The content library also allows you to store and organize your questions efficiently, making it easy to integrate them into multiple courses.

### How can I use the content library?

This content library is available to all instructors on a `Pro` plan, and includes over 5000+ questions which you can add with the click of a button.

-   Step 1: Click on the `+` button to expand the course items' view.

    ![PifylUTxZCpQLdrtqDIXQ](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/02-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/PifylUTxZCpQLdrtqDIXQ)

## What is modify availability?

`Modify Availability` is a feature to make your course items available on a specific date and a specific time. It's especially used for `Content Dripping`.

Content dropping is a method of releasing course materials to students at scheduled intervals rather than all at once. This approach helps maintain a structured learning path and prevents students from feeling overwhelmed by too much information at once. It also helps keep students engaged and ensures they are progressing through the course at a manageable pace.

If you want to adjust availability of course items:

-   Step 1: Click on the three dots infront of the course item you wish to modify.
    ![guDiXneRt-pYVcd8BBvhX](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/02-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/guDiXneRt-pYVcd8BBvhX)

-   Step 2: Click on "Modify Availability"

-   Step 3: Once you "Enable" the "Content Dripping" mode. You can selecte a date from which your course item will be made available.
    ![lCuI5qi5JETST3H2zipMz](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/02-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/lCuI5qi5JETST3H2zipMz)

-   Step 4: Click on `Save` and you're good to go.

###### Please make sure to publish all items to make them available to your students, your course items are in-draft by default and to make them available you will need to publish them.
