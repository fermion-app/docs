There are a few things to know before we dig deep:

1. If you have opted for a "Cohort Based Course", your `Manage syllabus` will look something like below. Here, you can schedule live sessions, add weekly assignments, and track student progress through the course timeline.

2. In case you've chosen a "Recorded Course", your `Manage syllabus` section will look like the below screenshot. This format allows you to create and organize content sections that students can access at their own pace.

3. In the case of a Cohort Based Course, Fermion by-default bifurcates your cohort duration into a weekly division, so that when you prepare your syllabus, it follows a weekly format. This helps in maintaining a structured learning path for your students.

4. In the case of a Recorded Course, Fermion gives you the ability to create "Sections". In every section, you can create multiple course items. When you create a section, one empty article is created by default, as sections cannot be empty. Remember this the next time you create a recorded course to ensure all sections contain valuable content.

## What are course items?

Course items are the components you can add inside your syllabus from the Fermion syllabus manager. These include articles, videos, quizzes, coding labs, coding assessments, and more. We'll discuss more about these in the sections below.

## Modify Availability

`Modify Availability` is a feature to make your course items available on a specific date and a specific time. It's especially used for `Content Dripping`.

Content dropping is a method of releasing course materials to students at scheduled intervals rather than all at once. This approach helps maintain a structured learning path and prevents students from feeling overwhelmed by too much information at once. It also helps keep students engaged and ensures they are progressing through the course at a manageable pace.

If you want to adjust availability of course items:

-   Step 1: Click on the three dots infront of the course item you wish to modify.
    ![guDiXneRt-pYVcd8BBvhX](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/02-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/guDiXneRt-pYVcd8BBvhX)

-   Step 2: Click on "Modify Availability"

-   Step 3: Once you "Enable" the "Content Dripping" mode. You can selecte a date from which your course item will be made available.

-   Step 4: Click on `Save` and you're good to go.

###### Please make sure to publish all items to make them available to your students, your course items are in-draft by default and to make them available you will need to publish them.
