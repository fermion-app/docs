Completion certificates provide a professional way to acknowledge and celebrate learner achievements in your courses. These digital certificates serve as formal recognition of course completion and can significantly boost learner motivation and engagement.

When learners complete your courses, they receive a personalized certificate that includes their name, course title, completion date, and a unique certificate ID for verification purposes. These certificates can be downloaded as PDF files, shared on social media platforms like LinkedIn, or printed for physical display.

You can enable certificates for:

- Recorded courses: issue when a student reaches a completion threshold (for example 100% or 80%).
- Cohort-based courses: issue after a specific date/time (for example cohort end date) regardless of per‑item completion tracking.
- Live sessions: issue after the live session ends.

## Enable certificates

1. Open any course and go to Settings > Completion certificate.
