## Dashboard overview

The detailed student report dashboard is organized into several key sections:

### Summary metrics

At the top of the dashboard, you'll see key performance indicators:

- **Quiz average score**: Overall average percentage across all quizzes completed by the student
- **Assignments submitted**: Total number of assignments the student has submitted
- **Streak**: Current consecutive days the student has been active on the platform
These metrics provide a quick snapshot of the student's engagement and performance.

### Student profile card

The student profile section displays essential contact and activity information:

- **Email address**: Student's registered email
- **Phone number**: Contact number (if available)
- **Last seen online**: Timestamp showing when the student was last active
- **Total video watched**: Total video content consumed with completion percentage

This information helps you understand the student's engagement level and provides contact details for outreach if needed.

</div>

### Content engagement breakdown

This section shows completion rates by content type, displayed as horizontal progress bars:

- **Videos**: Total time watched and completion percentage
- **Quizzes**: Completion status and performance
- **Live events**: Attendance and participation
- **E-books**: Reading progress
- **Articles**: Completion status
- **Contests**: Participation and completion

This breakdown helps you identify which types of content the student engages with most and where they might need additional support.

### Course items & activity

The "Course items & activity" table provides a clear summary of every piece of course content a student has interacted with, as well as their progress and engagement for each item. **Filter the table** by content type to focus on specific areas-choose from Articles, Contests, E-books, Live Events, Quizzes, or Videos.

For each course item, the table displays:

- **Item name:** The title of the course content.
- **Status:** Easily see if an item is:
  - <span style={{ color: "green" }}>Completed</span> - the student has finished the item.
  - <span style={{ color: "orange" }}>Incomplete</span> - the item is in progress or only partially completed.
  - Not completed - the item hasn't been accessed.
  - Not attended - for live events that were missed.

- **Details and activity:** Depending on the content type, you'll see:
  - Videos: Time spent watching (e.g., "258 sec").
  - Quizzes: Scoring status (e.g., "Not scored").
  - Live events: Access links to session recordings or event information.

![item-wise-breakdown](https://67d6ad5ef66ee0901532fd2f.storage.fermion.app/public-uncached/object-store-public-files/uploads/24-11-2025/Arc_WPux41C3xt.gabffm.png)

This granular view allows you to identify exactly which course items students have completed, how much time they've spent on each, and where they might be struggling.

### Course progress

The course progress section provides an overview of the student's advancement:

- **Overall completion**: Visual progress bar showing percentage completed
- **Completed items**: Number of course items the student has finished
- **Remaining items**: Number of items still to be completed
- **Enrollment date**: When the student first enrolled in the course

This gives you a clear picture of how far along the student is in the course curriculum.

## Using the analytics

The detailed student report helps you:

- **Identify struggling students**: Spot students who have low completion rates or haven't engaged with key content
- **Recognize high performers**: Find students who are excelling and might benefit from advanced content
- **Track engagement patterns**: Understand when and how students interact with your course
- **Provide targeted support**: Use the data to reach out to students who need help with specific content types
- **Monitor progress**: Track individual student advancement through your course curriculum

By regularly reviewing these analytics, you can proactively support your students and improve course completion rates.

## Bulk reset progress for multiple students

You can reset course progress for multiple students at once from the Students tab. This is useful when you need to allow students to retake a course or reset their progress after course content updates.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select students">

  </Step>

    Click on the `Actions` dropdown button located in the top right corner of the Students tab, next to the "Export all enrolled users as CSV" button.

  </Step>

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Important notes

- **Irreversible action**: Resetting course progress permanently deletes all completion data for the selected students. This action cannot be undone.
- **Selective reset**: You can reset progress for specific students by selecting only those students before choosing the reset action.
- **All students**: To reset progress for all enrolled students, select all students first, then use the "Reset all course progress" option.
- **Enrollment preserved**: Resetting progress does not remove students from the course; it only clears their completion data and progress tracking.
