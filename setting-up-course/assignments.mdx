Assignments are a crucial part of any [course](/setting-up-course/prerequisites). They help instructors evaluate learner progress, encourage hands-on practice, and reinforce understanding. A well-structured assignment bridges the gap between theory and application, allowing learners to demonstrate their knowledge in a practical and measurable way.

On Fermion, Assignments can be added as a dedicated section inside your course syllabus. They enable learners to upload and submit files, such as code, project reports, or documents, directly through the platform. Instructors can set deadlines, restrict file types for relevance or security, and review submissions directly from their dashboard. You can also grade assignments out of 10 and provide clear feedback for each student using remarks, making assessment seamless, transparent, and actionable.
