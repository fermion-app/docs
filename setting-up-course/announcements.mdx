Announcements are a powerful way to communicate directly with all students enrolled in a course. Think of them as targeted [email campaigns](/marketing-tools/email-marketing): each announcement is sent to every student associated with the particular course. Whether you’re sharing important updates, notifying about new [videos](/recorded-videos/introduction), or promoting upcoming [live sessions](/live-classes/what-are-live-classes), announcements ensure that your students stay engaged and informed at every stage of their learning journey.

## Possibilities

With announcements, you can create personalized email campaigns tailored to your course audience. You can format your content using rich text, add links, emphasize key messages, and even include visuals to make your updates more engaging. Each announcement can be tracked and managed directly from your course builder, helping you maintain simple communication with your learners.
