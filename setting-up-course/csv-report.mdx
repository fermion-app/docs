## Understanding the Data

### Column Naming Convention

The section-wise columns use a consistent format that makes it easy to identify:
- Which section the item belongs to
- The item type identifier (numeric code)
- The type of content (Lab, Assignment, Ebook, Video, etc.)
- The specific metric being tracked (Type, Completed, Score, Duration, etc.)

### Data Values

- **Completion/Submission Status**:
  - **Yes**: The student has completed/submitted the item
  - **No**: The student has not completed/submitted the item

- **Scores and Marks**: Numeric values representing the student's performance on graded items

- **Duration**: For videos, this shows the total video length in seconds

- **Timestamps**: ISO format timestamps (e.g., "2025-11-05T11:55:13.021Z") indicating when an item was completed or submitted

- **Completion Percentage**: A calculated value showing overall course progress as a percentage
