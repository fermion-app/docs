Empower your students with real-time, contextual assistance powered by AI! Fermion's **AI tutor** feature enables you to provide an intelligent copilot for your courses, giving learners immediate, context-aware support across quizzes, videos, and articles.

When enabled, the AI tutor appears as a copilot in the bottom-right corner of the student interface. This AI answers students' questions based on relevant course material, drawing from the following context sources:

- **Quiz**: Understands the quiz question and related concepts.
- **Article**: Reads the article content and supplementary materials.
- **Video**: Utilizes generated video captions and transcript.

The AI provides rich, targeted responses—boosting student learning and engagement.

<Step title="Enable AI tutor">
Toggle on **AI tutor** for the desired content types:

- **Quiz**: Students get AI-powered hints, explanations, or help while attempting quizzes, using the quiz questions as context.
- **Videos**: Students can ask questions about videos, and the AI uses captions/transcripts to help clarify concepts or summarize content. Make sure captions are turned on for your videos by following the steps [here](/recorded-videos/captions).
Captions are an opt-in feature with dedicated pricing, which can be checked [here](https://fermion.app/pricing)
- **Articles**: The AI answers questions with the full article text as context, helping students get clarifications as they read.

You can enable AI tutor for any combination of these content types depending on your needs.

</Step>

</Steps>

> **Tip:** Enable the AI tutor only on the formats (quiz, video, or article) where you want students to receive AI-powered help.

## Student Experience

Once enabled, students see an AI copilot button on the bottom-right of the content screen. Clicking it opens a chat, where they can ask questions about the current quiz, video, or article.

- The AI uses the course data and current item (quiz, article, or video captions) as context to respond, making answers highly relevant.
- This feature helps students without needing to switch tabs or wait for instructor replies.
