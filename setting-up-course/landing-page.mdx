Now that you've selected a course to get started with, this is how your landing page manager page screen is going to look like. In the below screenshot I'm using an example of a CBC, but depending on what course type you've chosen, you will be greeted with the respective screen.

_Let's go over every section one by one_

## Design your course metadata

![eMLzQQxRb-F4B3XOeF-Ly](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/01-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/eMLzQQxRb-F4B3XOeF-Ly)

Setting up your course metadata is the first thing you've got to do. This includes:

- Giving your course a good title
- A great tagline
- A catchy thumbnail

Every time you edit, your changes are being updated in the real time.

If you want to preview how your course landing page looks like, you can quickly jump to the bottom of the page, on the "Publish your cohort landing page section", where you'll find the link to your landing page upon publishing the course.

We'll talk more about this towards the end of this article.

## Set course goals and outcomes

![52zq7tHMNzSQEhcfU-wJj](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/01-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/52zq7tHMNzSQEhcfU-wJj)

This is the section from where you can set "goals" for your course.

Simply write things that students would accomplish upon completing your course. I've jotted a few things in the above photo for your reference.

Click on "Add More" to add another goal, add as many as you like!

## Set your cohort dates

Please note that this section is only included if you have selected "Cohort Based Course" while creating a course.

![s78fyCnj2IHDW6Bfvm6Eq](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/01-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/s78fyCnj2IHDW6Bfvm6Eq)

Each cohort comes with a clear start date, end date, and enrolment deadline, ensuring a well-defined timeline for both you and your students.

Pay close attention to the numbering marked in the above picture:

1. **Enrollment Deadline** - This is the date until which your students can join the course.
2. **Start Date** - The day when your course begins is the start date.
3. **End Date** - The last day of your course is the end date.

This is entirely up to you to customize when your course begins, ends, and stops taking registrations.

## Set course description

We take care of the tiniest of the requirements that you may need while setting up your course which is why, we've given you an efficient editor to write beautiful and neat course descriptions with powerful markdown support.

Make it as long and as detailed as you want it to!

## Set landing page FAQs

FAQs are a great way to quickly clear any possible doubts that your learner's may have.

![0F1nz4gQ5AgORDbcueR75](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/01-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/0F1nz4gQ5AgORDbcueR75)

You can add FAQs as well as their answers from right inside your dashboard. All of these FAQs will be reflected at the bottom of your course landing page.

## Set landing page reviews

Fermion makes it super easy for you to include reviews on your course landing page. And no, we do not mean for you to link your reviews to external sites but also create them from scratch on your descretion.

![ZyZ1FuGLe2dr9rbpDBS6G](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/01-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/ZyZ1FuGLe2dr9rbpDBS6G)

You can create detailed reviews by adding a lot of information like:

1. Name of the reviewer
2. The rating
3. Review content
4. Profile photo URL
5. Job title
6. Workplace name

The best part?

You can add as many reviews as you like!

## Manage syllabus

![8XhVyKDaZ7hPFnm_Txr4W](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/01-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/8XhVyKDaZ7hPFnm_Txr4W)

This is the area from where you can manage your curriculum, that means, build what you're going to teach.

Here, you can also choose to hide or show your syllabus on the landing page as you want. See the checkbox in the above screenshot? Simply check it if you'd like to show your syllabus, and uncheck if you'd like to hide it.

We'll talk more about this section in the next article.

## Publish your landing page

Once your metadata is finished, your course landing page is ready to be published.

![_wWjl0At13qQrXIZLo3rx](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/01-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/_wWjl0At13qQrXIZLo3rx)

Once you set a URL of your choice, simply publish your course. Upon publishing you will find the access URL in the same section. You can now see how your course landing page looks like!

You can also edit it as you like, in realtime.
