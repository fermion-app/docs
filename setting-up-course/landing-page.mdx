Now that you've selected a course to get started with, this is how your landing page manager screen will appear. The screenshot below shows an example of a CBC (Cohort-Based Course), but depending on your chosen course type, you'll see the corresponding interface.

Let's explore each section in detail

## Design your course metadata

![eMLzQQxRb-F4B3XOeF-Ly](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/01-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/eMLzQQxRb-F4B3XOeF-Ly)

Setting up your course metadata is the first essential step. This includes:

-   Creating an engaging course title
-   Writing a compelling tagline
-   Designing an attractive thumbnail

All changes are saved automatically in real-time as you edit.

To preview your course landing page, navigate to the bottom of the page in the "Publish your cohort landing page" section, where you'll find the link to your landing page once the course is published.

We'll discuss this in more detail later in this guide.

## Set course goals and outcomes

This section allows you to define clear learning objectives for your course.

Simply outline the skills and knowledge that students will gain upon completing your course. The image above provides examples for your reference.

Click "Add More" to include additional goals - you can add as many as needed to comprehensively cover your course outcomes.

## Set your cohort dates

**Note:** This section is only available when you've selected "Cohort-Based Course" during course creation.

Each cohort features clearly defined start and end dates, along with an enrollment deadline, ensuring a structured timeline for both instructors and students.

Please note the numbered elements in the image above:

1. **Enrollment Deadline** - The final date when students can register for the course.
2. **Start Date** - The official beginning date of your course.
3. **End Date** - The final day of your course.

You have complete flexibility to customize these dates according to your course schedule and enrollment preferences.

We've designed a comprehensive solution for all your course setup needs, including a powerful editor for creating detailed and professional course descriptions with full markdown support.

You can make your description as comprehensive and detailed as needed to effectively communicate your course value.

## Set landing page FAQs

FAQs are an excellent way to address common questions and concerns that potential students may have.

You can add both questions and answers directly from your dashboard. All FAQs will be displayed at the bottom of your course landing page for easy access.

## Set landing page reviews

Fermion simplifies the process of showcasing reviews on your course landing page. You can create authentic reviews from scratch within the platform, giving you complete control over the content.

You can create comprehensive reviews by including:

1. Reviewer's name
2. Star rating
3. Detailed review content
4. Profile photo URL
5. Job title
6. Company or organization name

The best part? You can add unlimited reviews to build credibility and trust with potential students.

## Manage syllabus

![8XhVyKDaZ7hPFnm_Txr4W](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/01-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/8XhVyKDaZ7hPFnm_Txr4W)

This section allows you to manage your curriculum and define what you'll be teaching.

You can also control whether your syllabus appears on the landing page. Notice the checkbox in the screenshot above? Simply check it to display your syllabus, or uncheck it to hide it from the landing page.

We'll provide detailed information about syllabus management in the next article.

## Publish your landing page

Once you've completed your metadata setup, your course landing page is ready for publication.

After setting your preferred URL, simply publish your course. The access URL will appear in the same section once published, allowing you to view your live course landing page.

You can edit the page in real-time as needed. Your courses can exist in three states:

-   **Draft:** Courses in draft state are only accessible to instructors.
-   **Unlisted:** Unlisted courses can be accessed directly via link but won't appear on the homepage by default.
-   **Published:** Published courses are publicly available and will be listed on the homepage.
