Now that you've selected a course to get started with, this is how your landing page manager screen will appear. The screenshot below shows an example of a CBC (Cohort-Based Course), but depending on your chosen course type, you'll see the corresponding interface.

Let's explore each section in detail

## Design your course metadata

![eMLzQQxRb-F4B3XOeF-Ly](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/01-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/eMLzQQxRb-F4B3XOeF-Ly)

Setting up your course metadata is the first essential step. This includes:

-   Creating an engaging course title
-   Writing a compelling tagline
-   Designing an attractive thumbnail

All changes are saved automatically in real-time as you edit.

To preview your course landing page, navigate to the bottom of the page in the "Publish your cohort landing page" section, where you'll find the link to your landing page once the course is published.

We'll discuss this in more detail later in this guide.

## Set course goals and outcomes

This section allows you to define clear learning objectives for your course.

## Publish your landing page

Once you've completed your metadata setup, your course landing page is ready for publication.

![_wWjl0At13qQrXIZLo3rx](https://creator-assets.codedamn.com/fermion-instructor/01-08-2024/instructor_66467ae8ada1f52e23942268/_wWjl0At13qQrXIZLo3rx)

After setting your preferred URL, simply publish your course. The access URL will appear in the same section once published, allowing you to view your live course landing page.

You can edit the page in real-time as needed. Your courses can exist in three states:

-   **Draft:** Courses in draft state are only accessible to instructors.
-   **Unlisted:** Unlisted courses can be accessed directly via link but won't appear on the homepage by default.
-   **Published:** Published courses are publicly available and will be listed on the homepage.
