## Global settings

Global settings allow you to configure platform-wide gamification options that affect all users. This is where you control maximum XP, enable leaderboards, and configure streaks to ensure your platform provides a motivating experience for learners.  

Head over to the **Gamification** section in your instructor dashboard sidebar to access these

### Maximum XP per user per day

Set a limit on the maximum XP a user can earn each day. By default, there is no limit, which means learners can accumulate as much XP as they earn by completing actions. This helps control excessive XP gain and maintain balanced progression.

### Enable public leaderboard

Enable a public leaderboard to show top users in the platform sidebar. This fosters healthy competition and motivates learners to engage more with content to climb the leaderboard.  

### Configure streaks

Streaks reward users for consecutive days of engagement. When enabled, a streak widget appears on their dashboard. You can also set the **Daily Streak XP Reward**, which defines how much XP users earn for maintaining their streak.
